<h3>"CATCHING COLDS"</h3>

<p>Mothers frequently wonder where their children get
colds. Briefly we will point out some of the sources from
which these apparently inexplicable colds may come.</p>

<p><b>A. Sitting on the Floor</b>.&mdash;Children should not be allowed
to sit or crawl upon the floor at any season of the
year, but especially during the winter months. There is
always a draught of cold air near the floor. It is a bad
habit to begin allowing a child to play with its toys on the
floor. Use the bed or a sofa or a platform raised a foot
from the floor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a>]</span>
<b>B. Kicking the Bed Clothes Off During the Night</b>.&mdash;The
bed clothes should be securely pinned to the mattress
by large safety pins. When it is established as a habit
a child who kicks off the bed clothes should wear a
combination night suit with "feet," made of flannel during
the winter and of cotton during the summer.</p>

<p><b>C. Inadequate Head Covering</b>.&mdash;Professor Kerley
states that this is one of the "most frequent causes of
disease of the respiratory tract in the young." He calls
attention to the fact that "mothers carefully clothe the
baby with ample coats, blankets, leggings, etc., before
they take him out for the daily walk. They dress him
in a warm room taking plenty of time to put on the
extra clothes, during which time the baby frets and
perspires. When all is ready they place upon the hot,
almost bald head of the baby a light artistically decorated
airy creation which is sold in the shops as children's
caps. The child is then taken out of doors and because of
the inadequate covering of the hot perspiring head,
catches cold and the mother never knows how it came."
Every baby and child should wear under such caps a skull
cap of thin flannel, especially in cold weather. In summer
or windy day a light silk handkerchief folded under the
cap is a very excellent protection.</p>

<p><b>D. Subjecting a Baby to Different Temperatures
Suddenly</b>, is liable to be followed by a cold&mdash;for example,
taking the child from a warm room to a cold room, or
through a cold hall, holding the child at an open window
for a few moments.</p>

<p><b>E. The Practice of Wearing Rubbers Needs Some
Consideration</b>.&mdash;They should never be worn indoors for
even five minutes. They should not therefore be kept on
in school, nor should they be worn by women in stores
when they go shopping. When it is actually raining, or
snowing, or when there is slush or wet mud they are needful;
but they should not be worn simply because the
weather is threatening or damp. Children should not
put them on to play&mdash;worn for any length of time when
active they are harmful. If worn to and from school they
should be taken off at once when in school or at home.
Wearing rubbers prevents free evaporation of the natural
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a>]</span>
secretion of the skin, keeps the feet moist and invites
colds and catarrh. In damp weather, or when children
play during winter months, they should be shod with
stout shoes with cork insoles.</p>

<p>The same argument applies to storm coats of rubber,
water-proof material. They should not be worn as overcoats
all day, but only when going to and from school or
business when it is actually storming.</p>

<p>Underclothing or hosiery should not be heavy enough
to cause moisture of the skin. Health demands a dry skin
at all times. The necessary degree of body heat should be
attained by the quality of the outer clothing, not by the
quantity of the underclothing. Many men and women
wear heavy underclothing which causes moisture when
indoors, with the result that they get surface chills when
they go outside if the weather is cold and as a result catch
cold. The underclothing should be just heavy enough to
be comfortable indoors and the extra warmth necessary
when outside should be supplied by a good overcoat or
furs.</p>

<p><b>F. Direct Infection</b>.&mdash;A baby may catch cold if kissed
or "hugged" by an adult who has a cold.</p>

<p>Catching cold while bathing is possible, but scarcely
probable, if ordinary precautions are taken. It is very
bad practice to permit children to use one another's
handkerchiefs or the handkerchief of an adult. Certain
children are predisposed to attacks of "cold in the head"
or acute coryza or nasal catarrh (these being the medical
names for this condition). Sometimes this is an inherited
characteristic. There is no doubt, however, that most
of these children acquire the habit by bad sanitary and
hygienic surroundings. These children do not as a rule
get enough fresh air. They are kept indoors most of the
time in stuffy, overheated, badly ventilated rooms, unless
the weather is absolutely perfect. The windows in their
bedrooms are always kept closed, because they are "liable
to catch cold." They are overdressed and perspire easily
and as a result "catch cold." These conditions all tend
to create an unhealthy condition of the nasal mucous
membrane and of the throat, and this is rendered worse
if the child lives in a damp, changeable climate, such as
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a>]</span>
that of New York City. In these susceptible children the
exciting cause of an attack may be trivial; exposure, cold
or wet feet, inadequate head covering (as already pointed
out), a draught of cold air even may excite sneezing
and a nasal discharge; hence we have:</p>

<p><b>Acute Nasal Catarrh (Acute Coryza, Acute Rhinitis,
"Cold in the Head", "Snuffles")</b>.&mdash;Acute nasal catarrh
may accompany measles, diphtheria, influenza, and
whooping cough.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;The onset is sudden with sneezing, and
difficulty in breathing through the nose. In a few hours,
or it may be not for a day or two, a mucous, watery, nasal
discharge appears. There are redness and slight swelling
of the nose and upper lip, caused by the discharge. There
is no fever as a general rule except in very young
infants, in whom the fever may be very high. The discharge
interferes with the nursing and the child suffers
from lack of nourishment. The inflammation may extend
to the eyes and ears, causing painful complications, or to
the throat and bronchi, causing hoarseness and cough.
Less frequently we have disturbances of the digestive
tract with vomiting, or diarrhea.</p>

<p>The mild form of the disease lasts for two or three
days, the severe form from one to two weeks.</p>

<p>Repeated attacks are said to contribute to the production
of adenoid growths.</p>

<p>An acute attack of this disease is seldom a serious affliction
in older children; it may be, however, very serious
and even dangerous in very young infants. The tendency
of the disease to extend downward, causing bronchitis or
pneumonia, explains in part the possible danger to a baby.
Another reason is because it may seriously interfere with
suckling and with breathing in these little patients. It
may even cause sudden attacks of strangulation. An
infant, therefore, suffering with an acute attack of rhinitis
requires constant attention. It may be necessary to feed
it with a spoon, and if necessary mother's milk should
be so fed. Plenty of fresh air should be provided. It may
be essential to keep the mouth open in order that it may
get enough fresh air. Every effort should be made to
keep the nostrils open. The secretions must be removed
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a>]</span>
from time to time. Causing the child to sneeze by tickling
the nose with a camel's hair brush will clear the nose for
the time being. The physician may be compelled to use a
solution of cocaine for this purpose.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Acute Rhinitis ("Taking Cold", Nasal
Catarrh, Acute Coryza, "Snuffles")</b>.&mdash;A child suffering
with an acute attack of "cold in the head" should be kept
indoors in a room with a constant, uniform temperature;
the particular reason for this is, that, if a child is exposed
to cold at any time during an attack of "cold in the head,"
it may cause the disease to invade the chest,&mdash;a tendency
which it has at all times. The bowels must be kept open;
if they do not move every day of their own accord they
must be made to move by means of an enema of sweet oil
or of soap-suds. The amount of food should be reduced
to suit the circumstances and the condition of the patient.</p>

<p>We treat the local condition in the nose with a menthol
mixture. The following is a very good one: Menthol,
30 grains; Camphor, 30 grains; White Vaseline, 1 ounce.
Put some of this on the end of the finger and push it
gently into each nostril. When the nostrils become
blocked and the child cannot breathe through the nose,
tickle the nose with a feather until it sneezes; this will
clear the passage. Immediately after the sneeze place
the menthol mixture in each nostril. When the child is
about to sneeze place a handkerchief before the nose, as
this discharge is full of germs and will infect others when
dry. Internal remedies should not be used unless the
child is distinctly sick and is running a fever, in which
case a physician should look the child over and prescribe
whatever is called for.</p>

<p>The upper lip and the nostrils of the child should be
protected, because the discharge very quickly irritates the
parts and renders them raw and painful. Vaseline or cold
cream is very suitable for this purpose.</p>

<p>Mothers should not wash out the nose of a child with
any solution advised for this purpose where force is used,
as, for example, with a syringe. Any forceful irrigation
of the nose is dangerous, because it would carry the infection
into the deeper parts and set up a more serious
condition.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a>]</span></p>

<p>If the above treatment is carefully carried out and the
child unexposed to a fresh cold, two or three days will be
sufficient to cure the disease.</p>

<p>It is not, however, the treatment of an acute attack of
"cold in the head" that is important; it is intelligently to
follow out a plan which will prevent these attacks from
repeating themselves that is of consequence. The tendency
to take cold is a real condition in childhood and a very
common one. When mothers appreciate that it is possible
to prevent this condition and to cure it when it is seemingly
an established habit, more interest will undoubtedly
be taken in the subject. Too frequently it is looked upon
as an unfortunate affliction, but it is never regarded as a
condition that is caused by neglect and ignorance.</p>

<p>It is an exceedingly common occurence to find a mother
worrying over her child's cold, dosing it with cod liver
oil or some other unnecessary tonic, rubbing it with
camphorated oil or plastering it over with certain useless
patent plasters, dressing it with extra pieces of flannel on
its chest and extra clothes pinned snugly around it, then
shutting it up in a warm, stuffy, unsanitary, ill-smelling
room, in order to keep it from "catching a fresh cold."
Can you imagine anything else she could do to defeat her
purpose?</p>

<p>No quantity of cod liver oil, no medicine, no coddling,
will remove the tendency to "catch cold." The child's
life must be lived amidst sanitary surroundings and hygienic
conditions first; then other expedients may be
utilized if necessary. These children must be kept out
of doors most of the time, unless during the severest wet
weather. They should sleep in a room the windows of
which are open at the top and bottom every night in the
year. They should not, however, be in a draught. The
rooms in which they live should be of a uniform temperature,
never too hot and never too cold, between 68&deg;
and 70&deg; F. These delicate catarrhal children should be
accustomed to light clothing on their beds. Chest protectors,
mufflers, cotton pads, and heavy wraps of any
description should be absolutely prohibited. It is advisable
to use flannel underwear winter and summer,
light in summer and a medium weight in winter.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a>]</span>
During the summer months the mother should begin cold
sponging of the face, throat, chest, and spine every morning
and carry it into the winter. The entire process need
take only a moment or two. Always dry thoroughly
with a fairly rough towel. If the cold sponging is begun
in the warm summer time the child will become so
accustomed to it that no objection will be made when
the cold weather comes.</p>

<p>If the child continues to be "catarrhal," despite a
course of this treatment, it would be well to investigate
whether any adenoids or adenoid tissue exist in the
naso-pharynx. If adenoids are found no treatment will
be successful until they are removed.</p>

<p>It is a wise plan to place a flannel cap on an infant
who has an acute attack of "cold in the head" (snuffles).
This will prevent catching a fresh cold and it will aid
in the speedy cure of the attack from which it is suffering
when it is put on.</p>

<h4>CHRONIC NASAL CATARRH&mdash;CHRONIC RHINITIS<br />
CHRONIC DISCHARGE FROM THE NOSE</h4>

<p>Some children have a nasal discharge during all of
their childhood. It is usually worse during the winter
months. It may be a thin, watery discharge or a thick,
nasty, yellow discharge.</p>

<p>It is a condition that is very frequently neglected even
by the family physician. This is unfortunate because
it may lead to serious disease, permanent damage sometimes
being done to the hearing, the speech, the smell,
and to the lungs of the child.</p>

<p>It may be caused by adenoids; disease of the bones or
tissues in the nose; foreign bodies in the nose; or it may
occur in children whose nutrition is bad. It may result
from frequent acute attacks of "cold in the head." It
also occurs in other less important conditions. The foreign
bodies which usually cause a chronic nasal discharge
are,&mdash;buttons, peas, beans, beads, paper balls, flies and
bugs, cherry-stones, small pieces of coal, or stone, cork
or other material. A child gets hold of a shoe-button
for example and pushes it into its nostrils. In the effort
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a>]</span>
to get it out the child pushes it further in. It may or
may not cause pain at the time, and it may be overlooked,
but shortly the mother will notice a discharge
from one nostril. This discharge becomes thick and
foul and when an investigation is made the button is
found embedded firmly in the nose. It is sometimes
quite difficult to get the button out and this should always
be done by a physician.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Remove the cause first then treat the
catarrh. If it is a product of a constitutional disease
that causes general poor health, such as tuberculosis,
syphilis, or scrofula, the child will need "building up"
and a decided change of climate. Foreign bodies must
be removed, adenoids taken out, large tonsils excised, and
malformations of the nasal bones operated upon. The
catarrh will in many cases be cured by removing its
cause; if, however, it should persist it must be treated
for some time with appropriate solutions. These solutions
and the directions as to the method of giving them
must be given by a physician, because there is great danger
of carrying the disease to deeper structures if given
wrongly.</p>

<p><b>SUMMARY:</b>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st.&mdash;A chronic discharge from the nose is a sign that
something is wrong and should be carefully and thoroughly
investigated.</p>

<p>2nd.&mdash;The cause can usually be found out and the proper
treatment will cure it.</p>

<p>3rd.&mdash;If the condition is neglected it may ruin the health
of the child for the whole period of its life.</p></blockquote>

<h4>NERVOUS OR PERSISTENT COUGH</h4>

<p>Cough in an infant or growing child is usually the
result of a cold and the structure affected is some part
of the nose, throat or bronchi. It is a comparatively
simple matter to discover just where the trouble is and
to prescribe the appropriate remedy and effect a cure.</p>

<p>There is another type of cough, however, that is of
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a>]</span>
quite a different character. This cough will begin as
an ordinary cough and it will only be discovered that
it is not an ordinary cough because nothing will apparently
cure it. We mean that the child is given cough
remedies that usually cure a cold, is kept in the house
and carefully watched for a sufficiently long period
to justify a cure, and yet, despite this care and attention,
the cough remains the same. The child is not
sick, the appetite is good, there is no fever, it plays and
seems to enjoy good health, yet for weeks and frequently
for months the annoying cough hangs on. It is as a rule
worse at night. It begins soon after the child falls
asleep and spoils the entire night's rest or a great part
of it. It may be a dry, hard, hacking cough, or a croupy,
harsh bark. It may come in spells with a considerable
interval between them, during which time the child falls
asleep, or it may be almost constant, not quite severe
enough to rouse the child, but bad enough to spoil the
child's rest and the rest of the mother. If this condition
lasts for a long time, as it occasionally does, the health
of the little patient is apt to suffer from loss of sleep.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;These children should be taken to a good
physician and thoroughly examined. Special care should
be devoted to investigating the condition of the nose,
throat, ear, stomach, heart, and lungs.</p>

<p>A very large majority of these coughs are caused by
adenoid growths in the back part of the nose. The child
may not look like an adenoid child, nor may it breathe
through its mouth when asleep, and it may have had its
adenoids removed, yet in spite of these contra-indications
it may have enough loose adenoid tissue in its
nose to cause this kind of persistent cough. This has
been proved many times.</p>

<p>It is not only useless but positively harmful to give
these children cough remedies. The cause of the cough
must be found and treated. The cough may be indirectly
caused by anemia (poor blood) or heart or stomach
trouble, or it may have a number of other causes. Whatever
it is it must be found by a careful physical examination
or a number of careful physical examinations,
because these cases are as a rule obscure and difficult
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a>]</span>
to diagnose, and even the most expert examiner cannot
always tell where the trouble is without seeing the
child a number of times. The parents must therefore
have patience and confidence in the physician and must
aid him all they can by watching and reporting all the
symptoms, etc., to him. (See article on <a href="#Adenoids">Adenoids</a>).</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY:</b>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Coughs that resist careful treatment are not "ordinary
coughs."</p>

<p>Coughs of this type require special medical care.</p>

<p>The usual cough medicines are not only useless in
these coughs, but dangerous. Don't give them.</p></blockquote>


<h4>ACUTE CATARRHAL LARYNGITIS: SPASMODIC
CROUP: FALSE CROUP</h4>

<p>Croup is one of the common diseases of childhood. It
usually follows a catarrhal "cold in the head" with a
cough. Croup is most frequently associated with large
tonsils and adenoids. It may come on gradually or it
may occur suddenly. There is always fever with croup.
One of the first symptoms is a hard, dry, croupy, barking
cough, which gets worse toward night. If it occurs suddenly,
the child will wake about midnight with the characteristic
croupy cough. The disease may go no further
than this and under the proper treatment is well in a few
days. In other cases, however, there develops marked interference
with breathing. Every inspiration is accompanied
by a loud hissing or "crowing" sound. This feature
of the disease is one that frightens the parents,
though it seldom means anything serious. The child sits
up in bed, frightened, and struggles for breath. It may
clutch its throat with its hands as if something was tied
round its neck. The lips may become slightly blue and the
perspiration appears upon the child's brow. After some
time,&mdash;it may be two or three hours,&mdash;the attack wears
away and the child goes to sleep. Next morning it wakes
up apparently well except for the croupy cough. The attack
may repeat itself the next night and mildly on the
third night.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The object of treatment during an acute
attack, when the child is struggling for breath, is to relax
quickly the spasm of the larynx which interferes with the
breathing. The simplest way is to give the child a teaspoonful
of the fresh syrup of ipecac. If the child does
not vomit in fifteen minutes, give another teaspoonful and
keep on giving it every fifteen minutes till the child
vomits. One or two doses is usually enough, but it must
be given till the child vomits.</p>

<p>If the attack comes suddenly during the night and
there is no syrup of ipecac in the house, the physician
should be sent for at once and informed that the child
probably has croup, so he may know what to take with
him. While waiting for the physician the mother should
apply over the front of the neck (in the region of Adam's
apple), hot applications. These are best made of flannel
wrung out of quite hot water every two or three minutes:
also a hot mustard foot bath. When the physician takes
charge of the case he will also direct the treatment for
the following day in order that the attack of the
next night may be a very mild one, if it should
came at all.</p>

<p>Children who have a tendency to frequent attacks of
croup should receive the same attention as the children do
who are subject to attacks of tonsilitis and acute catarrhal
rhinitis.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY:</b>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st. Spasmodic Croup always requires prompt and efficient
treatment.</p>

<p>2nd. It is called "false" croup, because "true" croup
is always diphtheritic and is a very serious disease.</p>

<p>3rd. For that reason a physician should always be
called because if it is "true" croup antitoxin must be
given at once.</p>

<p>4th. Don't worry unnecessarily because, though "spasmodic
croup" can make the child look exceedingly
sick for a very short time, an uncomplicated case in
a healthy child is seldom if ever dangerous.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a>]</span></p></blockquote>

<h4>TONSILITIS: ANGINA: "SORE THROAT"</h4>

<p>This is one of the frequent diseases of childhood. We
rarely see it in infants. It is caused by inhaling air which
contains poisonous germs. These germs quickly develop
when conditions are favorable. They lodge in the pores
or follicles of the tonsils and set up an active inflammation.
The tonsils swell up and the follicles exude a thick
fluid which looks like curdled cream. This fluid sticks in
the mouths of the follicles forming spots. If enough of
this fluid is coming out, these spots join together forming
patches, and the patches may join together forming membrane.
This is why it is sometimes so difficult to tell
whether the case is one of tonsilitis or diphtheria.</p>

<p>Conditions are favorable to the development of tonsilitis
if the child is not in good health when he happens
to inhale the infection, when the feet are wet or cold, or
when the child is allowed out during inclement weather
and it becomes chilled or numbed from cold, when the
child has a cold in the head and a running nose, or when
its stomach is out of order. Any condition in which the
child should be carefully watched and tended to, rather
than allowed further liberties, or risks, conduces to sore
throat of some kind.</p>

<p>Some children have the disease a number of times;
they seem to be predisposed toward a sore throat. These
are children who have large tonsils or who are rheumatic.
The tonsils should be removed in the one case, and the
tendency to rheumatism should be the main treatment in
the other case.</p>

<p>These children should be encouraged to cleanse the
throat and nose morning and night with a warm salt solution
(half a teaspoonful of ordinary table salt to three-quarters
of a cup of warm water). This will help greatly
to prevent these chronic sore throats.</p>

<p><i>Symptoms of Tonsilitis</i>.&mdash;The disease begins suddenly.
The child may have a chill or be seized with sudden
vomiting or diarrhea. A very young infant may have a
convulsion. The usual way is for the child to develop
a fever quickly, to complain of being sick and tired.
Muscular pains all over the body and a severe headache
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">509</a>]</span>
are constant symptoms. The fever is usually high from
the beginning. The child will tell you its throat is sore,
but there is as a rule very little pain in the throat. The
little spots or patches can be seen on one or both tonsils.
The general symptoms are more pronounced than the
local throat symptoms. The amount of physical depression
that is caused by a tonsilitis is out of all proportion
to the seriousness of the disease.</p>

<p>Tonsilitis lasts three days usually. The throat symptoms
may take a day or two longer to clear up, and the
patients feel more or less weak for some time after all
the symptoms have disappeared.</p>

<p>Tonsilitis is medically regarded as one of the mild
diseases of childhood. It is, however, of very great importance
because of its likeness to diphtheria, and inasmuch
as a positive diagnosis must be promptly made, in
the interest of the patient, it is given close attention and
treated with considerable respect by the medical profession.
The chief differences between the two diseases are
as follows:</p>

<p>Tonsilitis begins abruptly with pronounced prostration
and a high fever the first day. The patient feels distinctly
sick all over. The second day the patient feels somewhat
better, the fever is lower and the prostration and pain are
not so marked. The third day he feels better still, and
but for a little weakness would feel well. Diphtheria
begins slowly and insidiously, with very little prostration
and a very low fever the first day. The patient scarcely
feels sick. The second day more prostration is present,
the fever climbs upward a little more, and the patient
begins to feel sick. On the third day the prostration is
much more profound, the fever is higher, and all the evidences
of a serious sickness are present. Two very different
pictures: The one begins bad and ends easy, the
other begins easy and may end bad.</p>

<p>The important fact, however, so far as the similarity
of the two diseases is concerned, is, that we must make
the diagnosis positive on the first or second day, because
if we are dealing with a case of diphtheria we must
give antitoxin at once. This is essential, because the
efficacy of antitoxin is greatest when given early in the
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a>]</span>
disease. By "early" we mean the first or second day
of the disease. When antitoxin is given late (the third
or fourth day of the disease) it is much less efficacious
and must be given in relatively larger doses. The need,
therefore, of a quick, positive diagnosis is a real one.</p>

<p>Another important element involved in a speedy diagnosis
is, that we must not take any chances of infecting
other children. So important are these conditions that
it is the proper treatment to give antitoxin at once in
every case of tonsilitis that in the slightest way resembles
diphtheria. An examination of the throat contents,&mdash;a
culture of which is taken during the first visit of
the physician,&mdash;will, of course, reveal the true condition
and dictate the future use of the antitoxin. Antitoxin
is absolutely harmless when given to a patient who
has no diphtheria. Every case of tonsilitis should be
quarantined when there are other children in the house.</p>

<p>The local condition of the throat helps in the diagnosis:
In tonsilitis (as the name implies) the disease is limited
to the tonsils and on the tonsils (one or both) do we
find the spots or patches. In diphtheria, on the other
hand, the membrane is not limited to the tonsils, but
may cover every part of the throat and extend into the
nose and mouth. In tonsilitis it is spots or patches we
see in the throat. In diphtheria it is membrane we see
always. The difficulty here again is that if we wait till
the diphtheritic membrane covers the whole throat, antitoxin
will not be of much use.</p>

<p>In diphtheria we have a characteristic odor, in tonsilitis
we have no characteristic odor.</p>

<p>The practical lesson to be learned from this uncertainty
is, immediately to get a physician as soon as you
find spots in the throat of your sick child, unless you are
absolutely sure that the condition is not diphtheria and
you are willing to take that chance.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of an Acute Attack of Tonsilitis</b>.&mdash;Put the
child in bed at once and keep him on a light diet during
the fever. Give him all the cool boiled water he wants
to drink. If the fever is very high it can be controlled
by sponging the body with cool water. If the patient
is an infant the food should be reduced to one-half
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">511</a>]</span>
strength. Tonsilitis is a disease that runs a certain course
and gets better, or the patient develops some other more
serious conditions as a result of neglect or carelessness.
We therefore try to make the patient comfortable and
let the disease take care of itself.</p>

<p>The throat can be gargled or sprayed with any mild
antiseptic liquid, or it can be painted with tincture of
iodine or 10 per cent. solution of silver nitrate. As a
rule the gargles do not aid in the cure of the disease,
though they contribute to the comfort of the patient.</p>

<p>A cold compress made of half a dozen thicknesses of
cloth, such as a table napkin, and put under the jaw
(not round the neck), and covered with oiled silk and
held in place with a bandage that meets and is tied on the
top of the head, is of distinct usefulness.</p>

<p>When it is known that the child is rheumatic, the
heart must be carefully watched during the fever and
anti-rheumatic remedies depended upon to effect a cure.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY:</b>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Tonsilitis, because of its likeness to diphtheria, must
be promptly and carefully diagnosed.</p>

<p>A physician only is capable of making a diagnosis.</p>

<p>Any sore throat in a child with spots or membrane
is deserving of serious and immediate attention.</p>

<p>A mistake may mean death. Don't take a chance.</p></blockquote>


<h4>BRONCHITIS</h4>

<p>Bronchitis is one of the commonest diseases of childhood.
It is the cause of many deaths. Exposure during
inclement weather is as a rule the cause of it. It
occurs in all classes and conditions of children. Poorly
nourished and badly clothed children are more liable to
get it than are others. It is more dangerous in young
children and infants than in older children. A young
child or an infant will get bronchitis quicker than those
older and stronger under the same conditions.</p>

<p>Bronchitis is often present while children are suffering
from other diseases, measles, influenza, scarlet fever,
typhoid fever, pneumonia, diphtheria, whooping-cough,
for example. It may accompany any disease of childhood,
however.<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;In infants bronchitis usually follows a
"cold in the head," with running nose and a cough. The
child is indisposed and peevish because of the cold. In
a few days the cough becomes worse, fever develops,
the breathing is quicker, and the baby looks and acts
sick. The cough may be constant and severe; sometimes
the cough does not seem to bother the baby, although
this is exceptional. The breathing is quite rapid
and is accompanied with a moist, rattling sound in the
chest. The baby is restless and if the cough is severe it
becomes exhausted. Vomiting or diarrhea may be present.</p>

<p><b>Bronchitis in Older Children</b>.&mdash;Bronchitis in older
children comes on abruptly, with fever and cough. The
child may complain of headache and pains in the chest
or other parts of the body. It may begin with a chill or
chilly feelings. These children "raise" with the cough.
The expectoration may be quite profuse; at first it is
a white, frothy mucus, then yellow, and later a yellowish
green; it may be slightly tinged with blood.</p>

<p>There is a mild form of bronchitis in these older
children where the serious symptoms are absent. The
children are not sick enough to go to bed, but they appear
to have a "heavy cold" with, at first, a tight, hard
cough, which is usually worse at night. Later the cough
turns loose and the same expectoration occurs as in the
severe type. It is these cases of mild bronchitis which
do not receive the proper care and treatment that develop
into the so-called "winter cough," which lasts for
months.</p>

<p><b>Treatment.&mdash;</b>(See page <a href="#Page_497">497</a>
under heading, "Catching Colds.") Children who acquire bronchitis easily and
frequently, should be built up. Cod liver oil should be
given all winter. The sleeping apartment of these children
should not be too cold, but it should be well aired
through the day and well ventilated throughout the
night. Flannel night clothes should be worn and the feet
should be kept warm always. Mild attacks of "cold in
the head" should be treated vigorously and not neglected.</p>

<p>The following "Don'ts" may be profitably studied when
your child or baby has bronchitis:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>Don't keep the windows tightly closed; fresh
air and good ventilation are absolutely necessary to the patient.<br />

Don't use a cotton jacket or oil silk.<br />

Don't wrap the child up in blankets and shawls.<br />

Don't carry the child around; keep it in bed.<br />

Don't dose the child with syrupy cough mixtures.<br />

Don't overheat the room.<br />

Don't let friends bother or annoy the baby.<br />

Don't reduce the diet unnecessarily.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>The child should be put to bed. The temperature of
the room should be 70 degrees F. all the time. The windows
should be opened top and bottom according to the
weather, and the room should be well aired every day,
the patient being taken to another room while it is being
done. The child should have its usual night clothes
on, nothing more. If the child is not very sick and insists
on sitting up, a bath robe can be worn but it should
be always removed when it sleeps. It is advisable to
change the position of the baby from time to time. Have
it rest on one side, then on the other, as well as on the
back. Give a dose of castor oil at the beginning of the
sickness and keep the bowels open during the disease.</p>

<p><b>Diet.&mdash;</b>The diet will depend upon the severity of the
disease. If the fever is high and the cough persistent,
the strength of the food of nursing infants should be
reduced. We can reduce the strength of the food by
giving the child a drink of cool boiled water before
each feeding and shortening the length of each feeding.
Older children may be given toast, milk with lime water,
cocoa with milk, broths, gruels, custards, cereals and
fruit juices.</p>

<p><b>Inhalations</b>.&mdash;The value of inhalations in bronchitis is
very great. The ordinary croup kettle, which can be
bought in any good drug store, is the best method of
giving them. Full directions come with each kettle as
to the best way to use it. The best drug to use in the
kettle is creosote (beechwood). Ten drops are added to
one quart of boiling water and the steaming continued
for thirty minutes. The interval between steaming is
two hours and a half in bad cases day and night. In
mild cases the night treatments can be dispensed with.
Sheets rigged up over the top and sides of the crib, in
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a>]</span>
the form of a tent, is the most desirable way to give
the inhalations.</p>

<p><b>External Applications</b>.&mdash;Counter-irritation by means
of mustard pastes are the best applications. They should
be put back and front&mdash;one on back and one on the chest,
overlapping at the sides beneath the arms. They should
cover the entire body from the waist line to the neck.
These pastes are made as follows:&mdash;Mix the mustard
(English) and the flour in the following proportions, using
a quantity according to the size of child and area
to be covered; one tablespoonful mustard to three tablespoonfuls
of flour. Mix with lukewarm water until a
paste is formed, not too thick and not too thin. Spread
on a cloth (put plenty on) and cover with one layer
of cheesecloth and place the cheesecloth side next the skin.
In order to guard against burning the skin it is advisable
to rub the skin with vaseline, before and after putting on
the paste. The paste should be left on until the skin is
uniformly red. It may be applied from two to four times
in the twenty-four hours according to the severity of the
case. Mustard pastes are most effective during the first
two or three days of the disease.</p>

<p><b>Drugs</b>.&mdash;Drugs are of very little value in the treatment
of bronchitis. In the first stage of the disease,
when the cough is hard and dry, small doses of castor
oil and syrup of ipecac may be given to good advantage.
The following dosage should be followed closely: 1st
year, 2 drops castor oil, 2 drops syrup of ipecac, every
two hours; 3rd year, 3 drops castor oil, 3 drops syrup
of ipecac, every two hours; over 3 years, 4 drops castor
oil, 4 drops syrup of ipecac, every two hours.</p>

<p>The benefits from this treatment will be obtained in the
first two or three days, when it should be discontinued.
The cough under this treatment and the use of the mustard
paste and inhalations of creosote will be soft and
loose in two or three days and the fever will be distinctly
on the mend. The disease lasts from five to ten days.
It may, however, last much longer according to the
condition of the child, etc.</p>

<p>There are other drugs that can be given, with good effect,
but when other remedies are indicated a physician
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a>]</span>
should be called to prescribe them according to indications.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Bronchitis is one of the commonest diseases of childhood.</p>

<p>It is the cause of many deaths.</p>

<p>A large number of children have a tendency to bronchitis.</p>

<p>These children need careful attention and "building
up."</p>

<p>Do not neglect a "little" cold. It means trouble.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>Chronic or Recurrent Bronchitis</b>.&mdash;Bronchitis becomes
chronic when the treatment of an acute attack fails to
cure the condition. The failure usually is dependent
upon the condition of the child. It may be suffering
with some disease resulting from poor nourishment or
poor sanitary and hygienic surroundings or both. The
bronchitis, in other words, is dependent upon some other
condition, and will not get wholly better until the cause
is cured. These children should lead an active outdoor
life when the weather is favorable. Their sleeping-room
should be well aired and ventilated. Red meats are allowed
twice a week only. Sugar is cut down to the
lowest limit. Skimmed milk only should be taken&mdash;the
cream being too rich for them. They can eat freely of
fruits in season, green vegetables and cereals. The
bowels must move freely every day. Patients must be
given a lukewarm bath, followed by a brief spray of
cold water, daily. The cold spray should not be too
cold; about 60 degrees F. is the suitable temperature
of the water.</p>

<p>An absolute change of climate, to a warmer inland
atmosphere, is imperative before some of these patients
will begin to improve.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>A child with chronic bronchitis, or with frequent attacks
of bronchitis (or chronic colds), is usually
suffering from some other diseased condition.</p>

<p>The bronchitis, or the cold, will not get better until
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a>]</span>
you find out what that "other diseased condition" is.</p>

<p>It takes a physician to find that out.</p>

<p>Having found the cause, cure it, and the bronchitis will
disappear and the general health of the child will
immediately improve.</p></blockquote>


<h4>PNEUMONIA</h4>

<p>Pneumonia is a very common disease in childhood. It
is the most frequent complication of the various acute
infectious diseases. Pneumonia is an exceedingly important
factor in the mortality of infancy.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of pneumonia:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
1. Broncho-pneumonia.<br />
2. Lobar-pneumonia.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Acute Broncho-Pneumonia</b>.&mdash;Up to the fourth year
this is the form of pneumonia always present. It is the
form that always complicates other diseases all through
childhood.</p>

<p>It is most apt to occur during the spring and winter
months.</p>

<p>It affects all classes, but especially those whose hygienic
surroundings are poor. Catching cold is the exciting
cause in a large percentage of primary pneumonias.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;Broncho-pneumonia has no regular
course. It may or it may not follow a cold or an attack
of bronchitis. As a rule it begins suddenly with a high
fever, frequently accompanied by vomiting, rapid respiration,
cough, and prostration.</p>

<p>The child does not maintain a high fever continuously;
it varies considerably throughout each twenty-four hours.
It lasts from one to three weeks, and subsides gradually.</p>

<p>The respirations vary between 60 and 80 per minute,
though they may be much more frequent than this. The
child breathes with apparent difficulty, the soft parts of
the cheeks and nose rising and falling as it breathes.</p>

<p>The prostration becomes, as the disease progresses,
more and more marked, until the child looks profoundly
sick.</p>

<p>Cough is a constant and incessant symptom. It disturbs
rest and sleep and may cause frequent vomiting.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a>]</span>
There is no expectoration. A strong cough is a good
symptom; if it stops it is a bad symptom.</p>

<p>Pain is seldom present.</p>

<p>Blueness of the skin is a bad sign and indicates failure
of respiration and suggests constant and careful watching.</p>

<p>Delirium may be present during the disease. It is not
necessarily a bad sign. Accompanying stomach troubles
are frequent if the patient is very young, and are very
important. The bowels may be loose; they may be green
in color and contain much mucus. Large quantities of
gas may accumulate in the intestines and may cause much
distress and convulsions. Death may occur at any time
or the process may be arrested and recovery take place
at any stage of the disease. Broncho-pneumonia is not
necessarily a fatal disease in a fairly healthy child. It is,
however, always a serious disease.</p>

<p>Various complications may occur in the course of the
disease. The most frequent are: pleurisy, emphysema,
abscess of the lung, meningitis, heart disease, stomach
troubles, thrush, intestinal disease.</p>

<p><b>How to Tell When a Child Has Broncho-Pneumonia</b>.&mdash;If
a child develops a high fever, breathes rapidly,
coughs, and is content to lie in bed because of the degree
of prostration, broncho-pneumonia is almost certain to be
the disease present. If in addition to these symptoms
there is any blueness of the fingers or around the mouth
it is more strongly suggestive of pneumonia.</p>

<p>If the child has been suffering with bronchitis it is
sometimes difficult to tell just when the pneumonia begins.
The child will appear more profoundly sick, the fever will
go higher, and the respiration will be more frequent when
pneumonia sets in on top of bronchitis.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The nursing of a little patient with pneumonia
is the most important part. He must get plenty of
fresh air; consequently he should be kept in a well-ventilated
room. It is an excellent plan to change the patient
twice daily from the sick room into another which has
previously been thoroughly aired. While he is in this
room the sick room should be as thoroughly aired as is
possible. Keep this plan up all through the disease;
change the position of the patient in bed every two hours.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a>]</span>
He should never be allowed to lie on his back for hours
at a time. In this way the different parts of the lungs
get a chance to air themselves,&mdash;the air cells expand and
the oxygen in the air and the fresh blood tend to heal the
parts more quickly.</p>

<p>It would be distinctly wrong to go into the detailed
symptomatic treatment of broncho-pneumonia in a book
of this character. Inasmuch as this is one of the most
serious diseases of infancy, no mother should attempt to
treat it alone. A physician is absolutely necessary and
the most the mother can hope to do is to follow out his
directions to the letter.</p>

<p>He may direct the use of mustard pastes but it is essential
to know where to apply them. If he should request
the use of the cotton jacket, the height and character of
the fever must regulate its use. Stimulants are always
necessary, whisky and strychnine being given in every
case, but if given at the wrong time they may do more
harm than good. Cough mixtures may be necessary, but
frequently they are contra-indicated. Drugs and cold
sponging may be used to reduce the fever, but they are
dangerous if used when conditions do not justify their
use. Complications must be diagnosed when they occur,
and the correct methods of treatment promptly instituted.
A competent physician alone can assume the responsibility
of these various phases of the disease.</p>

<p>Every mother should appreciate, however, that pneumonia
is frequently the result of carelessness. It is a well-known
fact that pneumonia is an infrequent disease
among children of the well-to-do, because the hygienic
surroundings of these children are better and because
they receive competent attention if suffering with colds
and bronchitis. Bronchitis is quite common in all classes
of children, but in the lower walks of life it is the custom
to allow children to run around while they give every sign
of having a heavy cold, and a beginning bronchitis. These
children should receive treatment and should be kept indoors
and in bed if they have even a slight fever, as
pneumonia is frequently the inevitable outcome. They
should be carefully fed, and all signs of stomach or intestinal
troubles attended to at once.

<b>The After-Treatment of Pneumonia</b> is important, and
every detail has a distinct bearing on the ultimate recovery
and establishment of good health. Careful feeding,
a good tonic, and the proper attention to exercise,
fresh air and bathing are requisite. A change of air after
the fever is gone is more important than all other measures
put together. A dry, warm climate where patients
can be kept in the open air is preferable. The danger of
allowing a slow, long drawn-out convalescence after pneumonia
is the development of tuberculosis.</p>


<h4>ADENOIDS</h4>

<p><a name="Adenoids" id="Adenoids"></a>Adenoids are very common, almost
popular, in childhood. The condition is one that causes more real trouble
and discomfort than any other childhood affliction. Adenoids
are associated with, and are responsible for, many
of the ailments of childhood. They may be associated
with enlarged tonsils or they may be independent of
them. They may be present at birth or develop any
time thereafter, though they are more frequent between
the ages of two and six years. Children who have adenoids
invariably suffer from chronic "head-colds" with a discharge
from the nose. These chronic colds are caused by
the adenoids. Nearly every disease, and every diseased,
or abnormal, condition of the nose, throat, larynx, and
lungs can be directly caused by the presence of adenoids.
They are also responsible for numerous other conditions
of very grave importance in the growing child. The accompanying
"head-colds" may develop into a bronchitis
which may keep the child indoors for a long period. Adenoids
always interfere with respiration, thereby depriving
the child of a normal quantity of oxygen, thus rendering
the blood less pure, and, as a consequence, seriously interfering
with the nourishment and general health. The impaired
nourishment and poor health thus produced, as a
direct result of adenoids, renders the child more liable to
disease; he may thus acquire ailments that may affect his
whole subsequent life. The mental side of a child's development
is also affected by the presence of adenoids, so
much so that actual statistics prove that these children
cannot keep up with their classes in the public school.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a>]</span></p>

<p>We must therefore regard the presence of adenoids as
a serious menace to the health and comfort of the patient.
It has already been pointed out in discussing other diseases
that before a cure of these diseases could be permanently
accomplished it would be absolutely necessary
to remove the adenoids, which were, no doubt, the actual
cause, or an important contributing cause, of the disease.
Such conditions as catarrhal laryngitis, croup, chronic recurring
winter coughs, acute catarrhal rhinitis, "snuffles",
"cold in the head", chronic catarrh, bronchial asthma, incontinence
of urine, "bed-wetting", "nose-bleeding", headaches
in growing children, anemia, deafness, night terrors,
defective speech, diphtheria, consumption, are frequently
caused by the presence of adenoids.</p>

<p>These patients contract certain diseases easier than
other children, and when they do, they have them more
severely; such diseases are diphtheria, tuberculosis, scarlet
fever, measles, and whooping cough.</p>

<p>Adenoid children are, as a rule, in better health during
the warm, equable, summer weather than during the
changeable, uncertain weather we have in the winter
months. If the case is neglected, and if the adenoids
have existed for a long time, the growth of the child is
impaired. He remains small and stunted, and the expression
of the face is dull and stupid. The temperament
and disposition are affected also; such children are
languid, listless and depressed.</p>

<p><b>How to Tell When a Child Has Adenoids</b>.&mdash;Children
with well-developed adenoids are "mouth-breathers." Instead
of breathing through the nose they breathe with
the mouth open, especially when sound asleep. If a
child has a discharge from its nose and a chronic cough,
both of which resist treatment, and if in addition it is a
mouth-breather, it is safe to investigate the naso-pharynx
for adenoids. If a child with these symptoms is not in
good health, is listless and depressed, looks stupid, snores
at night, has difficulty in breathing and cannot blow its
nose satisfactorily, is troubled occasionally with "nose
bleeds" and headaches, we may be satisfied that the child
has adenoids, as no other condition could produce such a
picture.<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a>]</span></p>

<p>Adenoids, like enlarged tonsils, are dangerous, apart
from the physical distress and disease which they cause,
owing to the fact that they harbor deadly bacteria, and
from these bacteria, which find a lodgment in the adenoids
and tonsils, a fatal attack of diphtheria or consumption
may have its beginning.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Adenoids</b>.&mdash;Absolute removal is the only
justifiable treatment. This is rendered imperative for so
many reasons that it is unnecessary to go into details in
justification of the procedure.</p>

<p>The physical well-being, the mental development, the
life of the child depend upon it. Any parent who would
wittingly interpose an objection to the removal of his or
her child's adenoids, after they have been demonstrated
to exist, would be guilty of a grave crime.</p>

<p>The operation itself is not at all dangerous. It is over
in a few moments and the child is well in an hour or two,
so far as any pain or suffering is concerned.</p>

<p>Physicians are frequently asked if adenoids "grow"
again after removal. The answer is, "Yes," they sometimes
do. In a very small percentage of the cases they do
return. The older the child is when they are removed
the less chance there is of a recurrence. A child operated
on before it is two years of age is more liable to a recurrence
than a child operated on at six years of age. This
must not, however, be construed as an excuse for putting
an operation off, because if a child needs an operation at
two years and it is postponed till later, its health will be
permanently injured before it is four years of age.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Adenoids cause more trouble and more actual disease
than any other condition during childhood.</p>

<p>2. It is a crime for a parent to refuse operation if the
presence of adenoids has been proved.</p>

<p>3. Removal is the only treatment and it should be done
in every case as soon as possible.</p>

<p>4. The operation is a trivial one and is free from
danger.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a>]</span></p>


<h4>NASAL HEMORRHAGE&mdash;"NOSE BLEEDS"</h4>

<p>A hemorrhage from the nose may occur at any time
from birth on. It depends upon the rupture of one or
more blood vessels. The great majority of "nose-bleeds"
are caused by adenoids, or by a small ulcer in the nose, or
by an injury, such as a blow or fall. A nasal hemorrhage,
however, may be caused by other, more serious conditions,
and for that reason may justify a careful inquiry
into the cause, especially if bleeding should occur a number
of times, or be of a serious character the first time.</p>

<p>Of the more common causes as given above, the adenoids
should be removed, and the chronic catarrh which
is invariably the cause of the ulcer should be cured.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of an Acute Attack</b>.&mdash;Have the patient sit
erect; loosen all tight clothing around neck; fold the
hands over the head; apply cold to the back of the neck
and the nose. Pieces of ice can be put into the nostril
and the ice bag to the nape of the neck, or a piece of ice
can be put into a folded napkin and held on the back of
the neck. Taking a long breath and holding it as long as
possible and repeating it while the ice is being applied is
an aid. Placing the feet in hot mustard water is of decided
use. Another excellent expedient is to wrap absorbent
cotton round a smooth probe (piece of whalebone,
for example), dip the cotton in an alum-water mixture
(half teaspoonful powdered alum in a half cupful of
water), and then push it into the bleeding nostril as far as
you can with gentle force. A valuable remedy is Peroxide
of Hydrogen used full strength and freely dropped
into the nostril. If these measures fail, send for a
physician at once.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1st. Nose bleeds may be caused by some serious condition.</p>

<p>2nd. If they occur a number of times have the child
examined.</p>

<p>3rd. If the treatment outlined above does not stop the
bleeding in a few moments send immediately for a
physician.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a>]</span></p>


<h4>QUINSY</h4>

<p>Quinsy is not common in childhood. It usually follows
tonsilitis when it is seen. The child complains of pain in
the neck, extreme pain and difficulty upon swallowing,
and inability to open the mouth as much as usual. There
is a tendency to hold the head to one side. The treatment
is to open the abscess at the earliest moment after
pus is present.</p>


<h4>HICCOUGH</h4>

<p>Hiccough is, in most cases, in infancy and childhood
caused by some irritation of the stomach, may be over-filled
with food or gas. In these cases it is an unimportant
incident and may be quickly relieved by giving
the child an enema of soap-water and a laxative of rhubarb
and soda.</p>

<p>Infrequently hiccough may be the result of cold feet,
or a surface chill. Simple methods of relief are, to hold
the breath, to expire, or blow the breath out as long as
possible before taking the next breath; to sip water from
a cup held by another person while the tips of the two
fore-fingers are in the ears.</p>

<p>Hiccough is quite frequent in hysteria in girls, but it
is of no consequence. When hiccoughs set in during
the course of any serious disease it is a very unfavorable
sign.</p>


<h4>SORE MOUTH: STOMATITIS</h4>

<p>Stomatitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane
(inner lining) of the mouth. The gums and the inner
surface of the lips and cheeks may be red and angry-looking.
There may be small grayish spots on any part
of the mouth. If the case is very bad or if it has lasted
some time and has been neglected, these spots grow
larger and join together forming irregular grayish
plaques. A large percentage of the cases never go further
than this because the proper care and attention is
given them. It is possible, however, for any case to
progress further and become ulcerative. This will be
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a>]</span>
observed first as a faint yellow line at the margin of the
teeth and gum. Ulceration never takes place unless the
child has teeth. The quantity of saliva is very greatly
increased, so much so that it flows out of the mouth soiling
the clothes. The saliva is intensely acid and it consequently
irritates the skin, causing more or less eczema.
The mouth is painful and hot. There is slight fever,
but seldom any marked prostration. If, however, the ulceration
should be severe, the fever may be quite high.</p>

<p>There is one feature of these cases that sometimes
proves vexatious and annoying. Because of the soreness
of the mouth, the child cannot draw strongly enough on
the nipple to get a normal feeding, and as a result the
nutrition of the child is poor. These children are hungry
and when offered the nipple grasp it greedily, draw a few
mouthfuls then stop because of the pain and begin to cry.</p>

<p>If the ulceration is extensive, there is usually an odor
and the gums bleed easily. Sometimes the teeth fall out
or have to be drawn out.</p>

<p>Strong, well-fed children are as likely to develop stomatitis
as are those who are weakly and ill fed.</p>

<p>The disease is caused by infection and is contagious.
Just what the infection is we do not know; we do, however,
know that children whose mouths are carefully
cleaned after each feeding do not have sore mouths of
this character. When cleaning the mouth care must be
observed not to injure the tender mucous membrane.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;As soon as the condition is observed
mouth-washing should be systematically and thoroughly
carried out. After each feeding the mouth should be
washed with a saturated solution of boric acid in boiled
water. (See page <a href="#Page_626">626</a>.)</p>

<p>It is not necessary to use any further treatment, as a
rule. Patients recover in four to eight days. Strict attention
to cleanliness, however, is imperative. The feeding
bottle and nipple, or the mother's nipple, if breast
fed, must be kept scrupulously clean.</p>

<p>The feeding of these children is sometimes a problem
for a day or two, because, as stated above, of the soreness
of the mouth. This is best overcome by feeding the baby
with a spoon. If breast fed, it is necessary to pump the
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a>]</span>
milk and then feed with the spoon. Children will take the
milk better if it is fed cold. Cold boiled water is largely
taken and is good for them at this time.</p>

<p><b>Treatment for Ulcers in Mouth</b>.&mdash;The ulcers should
be touched with a camel's-hair brush which has been
dipped into finely powdered burnt alum. If a stronger
caustic is necessary, the solid stick of nitrate of silver
may be used.</p>

<p>A mouth wash may also be used in the ulcerative cases,
composed of the peroxide of hydrogen diluted with two
parts of water. If this is used wash the mouth out afterward
with plain, cool, boiled water. The peroxide mouth
wash can be used four or five times daily.</p>

<p>In addition to the mouth washing in the ulcerative
cases it is advisable to use internally chlorate of potash.
The druggist should be requested to make a two-ounce
saturated solution, and of this you can give one-half teaspoonful,
largely diluted with cool water, every hour
during the day for the first twenty-four hours, then
every two hours until marked improvement is shown,
when it can be further reduced by lengthening the interval
between doses.</p>


<h4>SPRUE&mdash;THRUSH</h4>

<p>Sprue is a form of sore mouth. It is seen only during
the first six months of life, as a rule. It affects the
mucous membrane of the mouth; it appears in the form of
small white spots that look like drops of curdled milk.
They are on the inner surface of the cheek and may be
all over the mouth, and on the tongue. The spots are
firmly attached, and if forcibly removed the mucous membrane
will bleed.</p>

<p>The disease is caused by infection through lack of
cleanliness and it invariably affects poorly nourished children,
especially those who are bottle-fed.</p>

<p>There are no symptoms other than those of the mouth;
the child frequently refuses to nurse because of evident
pain and distress while nursing. The condition is not
contagious. It may be cured in from six to eight days
without difficulty.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Mouth irrigations of boracic acid are all
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a>]</span>
that are necessary. They are given in the following way:
Place the child on its side, roll around the index finger
a piece of absorbent cotton, dip this in a saturated solution
of boracic acid, and put into the mouth of the child.
Let the cotton take up as much of the solution as it will
hold, so that when it is lightly pressed on the tongue and
cheeks it will flow out of the mouth, thus "irrigating the
mouth." Repeat this a number of times, pressing the cotton
to a different part each time. This should be gone
through from four to six times daily.</p>

<p>If the child is a bottle-fed baby, care should be taken
in cleaning the nipples and bottles as directed on page
264. If the patient is breast-fed, care must be taken to
note that the mother's nipples are clean. They should
be washed with the same solution of boracic acid and
not handled. If the child cannot nurse it is necessary to
feed it with a spoon.</p>

<p>In obstinate cases the parts may be touched with a one
per cent. solution of formalin. Mothers should particularly
note not to use honey and borax, as is often recommended
by women who know no better, in any disease of
the mouth in children.

<h4>ACUTE GASTRIC INDIGESTION</h4>

<h5>Acute Inflammation of the Stomach&mdash;Acute Gastritis&mdash;
Persistent Vomiting</h5>

<p>An infant seldom has real inflammation of the stomach.
Gastric, or stomach, indigestion is the better name,
because it actually signifies the true condition. It is indigestion
that causes a child to vomit, though it is possible
to have a true inflammation caused by the taking of irritant
or corrosive drugs.</p>

<p>Gastric indigestion causes sudden, repeated vomiting,
with prostration and occasional fever. It is caused by
unsuitable food, the wrong quantity of food, irregular
feeding, and food the quality of which is not good.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The stomach should be immediately
washed out. Until the physician arrives the mother can
encourage the child to drink a large quantity of cool
boiled water. This will be vomited and it will wash out
the stomach at the same time. No further treatment
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a>]</span>
may be necessary, as the vomiting may stop. All food
should be withheld for at least twenty-four hours. A
high rectal irrigation should now be given. It is essential
to know that the bowel is absolutely clean in all
vomiting cases. The normal salt solution is the best
agent to use for a high enema in infants. (See page <a href="#Page_586">
586</a>.)</p>

<p>After twelve or twenty-four hours' abstinence from
food, the child can be given teaspoonful doses every
twenty minutes of cooled boiled water, or barley or albumen
water, weak tea, or chicken broth. Cold liquids
are better retained and more readily taken than those
that are heated. If the liquid feedings are vomited, another
twelve hours must elapse before trying stomach
feedings. In these cases we must try to satisfy the
thirst by giving cold colon flushings. If the case becomes
protracted and we find it impossible to nourish
the child by the mouth, we must wash the stomach out
once every day with a five per cent. solution of bicarbonate
of soda, and feed the child by the rectum. Sometimes
we can feed through the stomach tube. Liquids
will frequently be retained when put into the stomach
through a tube when they will be vomited if swallowed.</p>

<p>The best food by the rectum is plain peptonized milk.</p>

<p>Drugs are absolutely useless. If the vomiting persists,
despite the above efforts to stop it, there is nothing to be
gained by experimenting. You will not only render the
condition worse but you will weaken the child. Morphine
given hypodermatically is the only remedy. Given
in appropriate doses, according to age, it is absolutely
harmless. It will not only stop the vomiting, but it will
give the child a much-needed rest, by allowing it to go to
sleep. When it wakes up it will be stronger and its
stomach will most likely retain small doses of nourishment.</p>

<p>Great care must be exercised, in getting the child
back on a normal diet, not to try to go too fast.</p>

<p>In cases of persistent vomiting in children I have
found it advisable to use teaspoonful doses of ice-cold
champagne. These children will sometimes keep this
down when all other liquids will be vomited. It is absolutely
necessary to keep the child lying down. If he is
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a>]</span>
restless or sits up, the vomiting may begin all over again.
The champagne not only is excellent nourishment for
the child, but it quiets the stomach, allays irritability,
and frequently favors sleep, during which time a cure
very often results. The champagne must be drawn
through a champagne siphon (procured in the drug
store), and the bottle must be kept on ice with the
mouth downward; otherwise it will get stale very quickly
and be of no use. If kept as advised it will remain
good to the end.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY:&mdash;</b></p>

<blockquote><p>1st. Persistent vomiting in a child means acute gastritis.
Stop all food for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>2nd. Encourage the child to drink large quantities of
slightly warm water; this will wash the stomach
out and frequently stops the vomiting.</p>

<p>3rd. When the child is quiet wash out the bowels.</p>

<p>4th. If vomiting persists, use iced champagne as directed.</p></blockquote>


<h4>ACUTE INTESTINAL DISEASES OF CHILDREN</h4>

<p>The large infant mortality that results from intestinal
diseases during the summer months is deserving of the
most careful consideration, both of the physician and the
parent.</p>

<p>Apart from the excessive heat of the summer, there
is no doubt that an unfavorable environment, which
means bad hygienic surroundings, bad sanitary conditions,
bad food and home influences, contributes largely
to the enormous number of these serious cases. Education,
while it may be expected to influence favorably
the sanitary and other conditions in the home, cannot
change the home location. The child must continue to
live in the same environment. It is in this class of cases
that these summer diseases are so very fatal. Children
in better circumstances can take advantage of conditions
which are denied to the tenement child. The diseases
must therefore be faced and treated under these existing
conditions.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a>]</span></p>

<p>In addition to the climate and the environment, there
are certain factors that occur in all classes which result
in intestinal derangement. If the stomach or bowels are
not performing their function properly, or if the food
or method of feeding is wrong, these, plus very hot,
humid weather, invariably result in serious intestinal
disease. The mother must be taught to interpret properly
the meaning of a green, loose stool in the summertime;
she must appreciate that it is the danger signal and
must be regarded seriously.</p>

<p>The very best preventive against summer diseases of
the intestine is to guard particularly against any trouble
with the child's stomach at all seasons of the year. A
healthy stomach and bowel will resist disease, even in
very hot weather.</p>

<p>The most important food product which has a direct
relationship to this class of diseases is milk. In a large
city like New York it will remain impossible to solve the
milk problem, despite the splendid efforts of the Health
Department and the members of the medical profession,
until the city itself shall establish milk depots and ice
stations where safe milk, and ice to keep it safe, may be
obtained at a nominal cost, or free, if the parents cannot
afford to buy it. We, therefore, must recognize that the
vast majority of children to-day are taking milk that is
not suited to them, that is really not fit as a food for
children. The mothers do not know this and no steps
are taken to render the milk more safe for them to feed
to their children. These mothers are willing to do what
is essential in the interest of their children, but they do
not know what should be done. These people cannot
afford a physician or a nurse to teach them, nor do they
even know that their methods are wrong or that they
need any instruction. We must carry the information
and the explanation to them. We must show them the
need for a change of methods. This is the work for
those charitably disposed women who desire some worthy
purpose in life, who really wish to do some real good.
All the equipment they need is good common sense.
They will tell these mothers why it is necessary to pasteurize
the milk before feeding it to the baby. They
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a>]</span>
will show how to keep the nursing bottles clean, and the
nipples sweet and fresh. They will instruct them how
to dress the baby in the hot weather and impress them
with the need of giving it all the cool, fresh air possible.
In short, they will gain the confidence and the good will
of these mothers in a tactful and diplomatic way, and
they will tell them all they know in language which they
will understand regarding the care of the baby. In every
city in the country this work is needed and is waiting for
the missionaries who will volunteer. To teach mothers
the need for boiled water as a necessary drink for baby
and older children is alone a worthy avocation. To impress
upon one of these willing but ignorant mothers
the absolute necessity for washing her hands before she
prepares her baby's food, that she must keep a covered
vessel in which the soiled napkins are placed until
washed, that she should frequently sponge her baby in
the hot weather, and explain thoroughly why these are
important details, is a work of true religious charity.
They should be specially taught to immediately discontinue
milk at the first sign of intestinal trouble, to give
a suitable dose of castor oil and to put the child on barley
water as a food until the danger is passed. They should
be taught to know the significance of a green, watery
stool, they should know that is the one danger signal in
the summer time that no mother can ignore without wilfully
risking the life of her baby. They should be taught
to prepare special articles of diet when they are needed.
If every mother were educated to the extent as indicated
in the above outline the appalling infant mortality would
fall into insignificance. It is not a difficult task nor
would it take a long time to carry it out; it is the work
for willing women who have time and who perhaps spend
that time in less desirable but more dramatic ways.</p>

<p>It is the knowledge that aids in catching disease in its
inception that counts. The worst infections begin as a
mild condition and prompt treatment robs them of their
sting. When treatment is delayed and the child is fed
for twenty-four hours too long on milk, the condition
which in the beginning could have been stopped
promptly has developed and it becomes a fight for life.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a>]</span></p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that all we need is education.
Education of the mother primarily, but education
of the missionary, the nurse, the physician, the municipality,
and the State, each co-operating, each willing
to work in the interest of a great cause, for the benefit
of the human race and for the brotherhood of man.</p>


<h4>ACUTE INTESTINAL INDIGESTION</h4>

<p><b>Causes</b>.&mdash;Overfeeding, unsuitable and improper food,
irregular and indiscriminate feeding, sudden change
from one food to another, as at weaning time, a change
from a poor quality to a rich food, or vice versa. Conditions
affecting the health of the child, especially the
nervous system, such as hot weather, extreme cold,
fatigue, or at the beginning of any of the acute diseases.
Children sometimes are predisposed to attacks of intestinal
indigestion; these children are delicate in health
and have weak digestive ability. The slightest irregularity
or error in diet will cause an attack in these
children.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;The attack may come on suddenly or it
may develop slowly. The important constitutional symptoms
are fever, prostration, and a general nervous irritability.
The child is seized with pain in the abdomen.
The pain is referred to the region around the navel. It
is sharp, colicky, and severe, causing the child to cry out
and draw up its legs in an effort to lessen its severity.
The child is exceedingly restless and acts as if it were
on the verge of a dangerous illness. Gas in the bowel
is not present as a rule as frequently as it is in infants
under the same circumstances. In a few hours diarrhea
sets in, the stools may number from four to twelve
or more in twenty-four hours. The stools are acid, sour,
and the odor may be very foul. They are thinner than
usual and frothy from the presence of gas.</p>

<p>In very young infants suffering from a sudden attack
of intestinal indigestion, the stomach, as well as the
bowels, is invariably upset. If the indigestion is the result
of a slower process, the stomach does not participate
in the process. The color of the stools in infancy is
yellow, then yellowish-green, and later grass-green.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">533</a>]</span>
Undigested food is always present and in infants the curdled
casein of the milk appears as white specks or lumps in
the movements.</p>

<p>The fever is high in the sudden cases and lower in
the cases of gradual onset. The prostration is more
severe when the onset is sudden and in infants may be
very marked.</p>

<p>The termination of the disease depends upon the
cause, the treatment, and the previous health of the child.
In healthy children promptly and properly treated it
may be all over in a week. In delicate, poorly nourished
children, and especially in the summer time, it may be
the beginning of trouble that may eventuate in death.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;There is no condition in the whole realm
of diseases of childhood where the knowledge of the
mother may have such important results as this condition.
The most effective time to treat these cases of
intestinal indigestion is before the physician is called.
There are few diseases in which time is so valuable, so
far as final results are concerned, as it is here. Every
mother should know the significance of a loose, green
stool. She should be taught that it means danger and
consequently demands prompt treatment. The first indication
is to empty, thoroughly, the bowel. The best
means for this purpose, if it is immediately procurable,
is calomel. If calomel is not procurable at once give
castor oil, two teaspoonfuls to an infant, one tablespoonful
to an older child. Calomel should be given in one-eighth-grain
doses, repeated every three-quarters of an
hour for eight or twelve doses, until the bowel is thoroughly
cleaned out. Don't be afraid of a few extra
movements at the beginning. Better clean out thoroughly
at the start than to be compelled to do it all over
again after the child is weak and suffering from the
poison of the disease. The next important thing to do
is to stop milk at once. The thirst is usually intense
and if vomiting is not present it can be moderately relieved
by giving small quantities frequently of cool boiled
water or mineral water or strained albumen or barley
water. We quite often have to stop all food and liquids
by the mouth for twenty-four hours.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a>]</span></p>

<p>If the prostration is very great and the child looks
as though it might collapse, it can be given brandy in
cracked ice from time to time.</p>

<p>After the bowels have been thoroughly cleaned out,
never before, some medicinal agent may be given to stop
the unnecessary diarrhea. In a very large number of
promptly and properly treated cases this is not needed.
If it is thought best to use it the physician will select
the agent according to the conditions present and prescribe
it.</p>

<p>Breast-fed infants rarely have intestinal diseases of
a severe type. If they should develop diarrhea they
must be taken off the mother's milk for twenty-four
hours. They should be given a dose of castor oil or calomel
and fed on barley water in the interval. The feedings
should be reduced in quantity and the interval doubled.
The two-hour interval will become a four-hour feeding:
the three or four ounces at each feeding can be
reduced to two ounces. The intention is to simply give
as little as possible while the diarrhea is under way.</p>

<p>The mother's breasts must be pumped at the regular
feeding time in order to preserve the flow, release the
pressure, and keep the milk fresh.</p>

<p>It is sometimes a problem to renew feedings of milk
without exciting a relapse of the diarrhea. It should
not be tried until the stools are normal in color and consistency.
This may not be for three or four days. In
resuming the milk it should be given in smaller amounts
and diluted with lime water or barley water for the first
day. Gruels may be given to which skimmed milk may
be added: later add the ordinary milk. If it is well digested
and does not cause any return of the diarrhea,
the quantity of milk can be slowly increased until the
former feedings are resumed. It is often of very great
advantage to boil the milk for some time. Peptonized
milk is safe and can be used in bottle-fed infants after
diarrhea. In older children, meat, broths, eggs, boiled
milk, and dry toast bread may be used sparingly for
some time. Cereals, vegetables, fruits, should be withheld
for a considerable time and watched carefully when
resumed. Kumyss, buttermilk, matzoon, bacillac, and
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a>]</span>
other fermented milks are better borne than plain milk.
All of these children need rest, fresh air, change of air,
frequent bathing, and tonics, as an attack of this kind
leaves them depressed, weak, languid, and anemic.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY:&mdash;</b></p>

<blockquote><p>1st. When a child complains of sharp, colicky, severe
pains in the abdomen, around navel, which are shortly
followed by foul, sour, frothy diarrhea,&mdash;greenish
in color, it has acute intestinal indigestion.</p>

<p>2nd. Every mother should know that a green stool
means danger. She should know to give at once
a cathartic,&mdash;castor oil is good, but give a good
large dose&mdash;then stop all food for twenty-four
hours. If she learns this lesson she will have time
to wait for the doctor; meantime, she may have
saved her child's life.</p></blockquote>


<h4>CHILDREN WITH WHOM MILK DOES NOT AGREE</h4>

<p>Contrary to the general belief, there are quite a large
number of children in whom milk seems to act as a
poison. These children are not necessarily constipated.
They suffer, however, from a slow, continuous intestinal
toxemia or poison. The symptoms of this condition are
headache, disorders of speech, habitual sleep-talking,
sleep-walking, and general nervous irritability without
cause: they are listless, languid, and constantly tired.
They may be bright in the morning and sleepy in the
afternoon. They are irritable and cross and touchy.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Milk must be wholly discontinued. Eggs
must be restricted to one every second day, and meat
but once daily. The use of green vegetables is particularly
suitable and should be given daily. Cereals and
fruit also are good. Malted milk, kumyss, or matzoon
may be given in place of milk. If constipation is present,
rhubarb and soda mixture is an excellent laxative
in these cases. A tonic should be prescribed for all
these children.</p>


<h4>DYSENTERY&mdash;ENTERITIS&mdash;ENTERO-COLITIS&mdash;INFLAMMATORY
DIARRHEA</h4>

<p><b>Cause</b>.&mdash;Any cause which has been mentioned as a
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a>]</span>
cause of ordinary diarrhea may result in this disease.
It may occur at any time of the year and at any age.
It may follow the infectious diseases. It may follow
any other disease of the intestines.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;It may begin like an ordinary attack of
acute intestinal indigestion. There is usually vomiting,
fever, pain, and frequent yellow or green stools. The
passages may be blood-stained and there may be little or
much mucus. The stools at the beginning have no
odor as a rule. The bowels move very frequently, often
with little or nothing to pass. There may be pain with
each movement. The blood may disappear in a few days,
but the mucus remains, often in large quantity in each
stool.</p>

<p>At the beginning the fever is high, but it soon falls
and remains low during the attack. The child loses
weight, is irritable, has no appetite, and looks and acts
sick. When the attack is over these children do not
gain their strength as readily as we would like; recovery
is slow.</p>

<p>The acute symptoms usually last about one week,
after this time the child begins to recover, but the process
is a tedious one and one in which much care has to
be exercised. It is an encouraging sign to note the disappearance
of the blood in the stools and the return of
the movements to the normal brown color. When these
favorable signs are wanting the bowel is probably ulcerated
and it will take a much longer time to return
to normal and to be free from blood and mucus.</p>

<p>The above is the ordinary form of this disease and it
ends in recovery as a rule. There is a more severe form,
however, which differs from the above in the following
way:</p>

<p>The fever is high and remains high; the stools are
more frequent and there is more blood and more mucus
in them; the child is much more irritable and is more
profoundly sick. Death may occur at any time from
the second day. If the little patient survives, the return
to health is a very slow process; it often takes months
and frequently years before a reasonable degree of
strength is regained. Relapses are common, and they
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a>]</span>
are very difficult to treat and care for. In some cases
the child never wholly regains its former strength.</p>

<p>There are children who have been the victims of other
intestinal diseases or conditions who develop colitis.
The colitis in these cases may come on suddenly with
vomiting and high fever, or it begins slowly, with no
vomiting and with little fever. Their appetite is poor,
their digestion is feeble, their prostration is pronounced.
They lose flesh rapidly and may be emaciated to a remarkable
degree. Very few of these cases recover completely.
Serious and sometimes fatal relapses may take
place. The feeding of these children is a difficult task
and the greatest care must be constantly taken; a very
little mistake may cost the life of the child.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;All diseases of the intestine in childhood
should be promptly and efficiently treated. If any form
of diarrhea is neglected, it may result in the development
of ileo-colitis with all its risks and uncertainty.
When a child is seized with sudden bowel trouble, no
matter what variety it is, it should be treated with the
greatest care because "sudden" bowel trouble usually
means plenty of trouble if it is neglected.</p>

<p>Fresh air is essential in all these cases. A change of
air is of decided value as soon as the immediate symptoms
have abated. The diet is the same as for children
who have gastro-enteric intoxication. Later, much difficulty
will be met because these patients have absolutely
no appetite,&mdash;peptonized skimmed milk is always good,
beef broths are often well borne, liquid beef peptonoids
may be tried. The food should be given every three
hours. Boiled water and stimulants may be given between
the feedings. Later in older children, raw beef,
eggs, boiled milk, kumyss, or matzoon and gruels may
be given. Great care has to be taken for months after
an attack; relapses may be caused by changes of temperature,
by fatigue, and, of course, by improper feeding.
These children should avoid potatoes, tomatoes, fruits,
corn, oatmeal, and a great many other things which
an intelligent mother would not give any sick child, as
candy, cakes, pastries, etc.</p>

<p>Cases which begin with free vomiting, thin stools;
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a>]</span>
and fever should be treated at once. The bowels must
be thoroughly cleaned out, the colon should be thoroughly
irrigated, and all food should be stopped. When
there are bloody stools with mucus and pain we must
depend upon castor oil, irrigations of the colon, and
opium and bismuth by the mouth. A good big dose of
oil at the beginning is always necessary. If, however,
the stomach is irritable and will not tolerate castor oil,
we may substitute calomel in one-fourth-grain doses
every hour for six doses, to be followed by citrate of
magnesium. Irrigation of the colon in these cases is
one of the essential means of successful treatment; it
should be done twice a day during the first few days
of the disease.</p>

<p>Stimulants are needed in all the cases. They help
the heart, act as a food, and tend to quiet the general
nervousness by favoring sleep. Good brandy given in
boiled cool water is the best stimulant.</p>

<p>After the child is over the worst of the acute symptoms
all medicine should be withdrawn and the proper
kind of food given. Tonics will aid in restoring the
strength. Cod Liver Oil during the following winter
is a very good plan to aid in building up the vitality
of the weakened bowel, but it must not be given too
soon.</p>


<h4>CHRONIC ILEO-COLITIS&mdash;CHRONIC COLITIS</h4>

<p>Chronic Ileo-colitis fellows the acute variety. Cases
which are unusually severe or which have been badly
managed are likely to become chronic. A child suffering
from this disease presents the following picture:
The patient is emaciated, the abdomen is usually enlarged
with gas, the feet are cold, the circulation of
the blood is poor, the fever is low or absent altogether
except when the child is having a relapse, when it jumps
up suddenly. The bowels are loose and contain mucus,
frequently in large quantities. The mucus may
stop for a few days; then it appears again with a rise
of temperature accompanied with loose stools with foul
odor. These children are exceedingly nervous and irritable
and are very poor sleepers.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a>]</span></p>

<p>Parents should be told it will be impossible to effect
a rapid cure of these cases. It often takes months to
get them started on the safe road. The slightest mistake
or change in the weather will upset the progress
of the cure and it will be necessary to begin all over
again. The entire hope of cure rests with the mother.
She must be faithful, patient, and must carry out the
physician's instructions implicitly. The management
consists in diet, change of climate, and such other treatment
as the physician finds necessary in each individual
case.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;In children under one year of age the
only hope is breast milk, which must be given in small
quantities. They do not do well on any starch food for
a considerable period.</p>

<p>Where breast milk is not available the whites of two
or three eggs may be given daily. They may be beaten
up and given in skimmed milk, or in plain water with
a little salt added. Zwieback or bread crumbs may be
given in small quantities. They should be fed at four-hour
intervals.</p>

<p>Older children may take skimmed milk, raw scraped
beef, junket, and coddled white of egg or raw egg, bread
crumbs, toasted, or zwieback.</p>

<p>A rectal enema must be given every twenty-four hours
if the bowels have not moved. If constipation is the
habit a laxative should be given; the aromatic fluid extract
of cascara sagrada or magnesia are suitable. At
least one free movement every day is essential to success.</p>

<p>Colon irrigations are only to be used when there is
a rise of temperature, irrespective of whether the bowels
have moved or not.</p>

<p>When convalescence is established these children
should be given a maximum of fresh air and should be
treated as recommended in cases of malnutrition.</p>


<h4>SUMMER DIARRHEA</h4>

<p>As the name implies, this is the form of diarrhea that
is so common, especially in cities, in summer. It is always
preceded by some milder condition which paves
the way for the more serious diarrhea. Acute
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a>]</span>
indigestion is, as a general rule, the forerunner of cholera
infantum. The influence of hot weather must always
be kept in mind as the underlying factor which no doubt
conduces to gastro-intestinal disease of infancy and
childhood. The depression incident to a spell of hot
and possibly humid weather tends to interfere with the
digestive process of babies and children. When this
function is carried on imperfectly, the strength and vitality
of the child fails, and if immediate steps are not
taken to check the process, diarrhea makes its appearance.
If these children are improperly fed, or if their
surroundings are not sanitary; if they are not getting
fresh air enough, or if they suffer because of lack of
attention, and have at the same time a little indigestion,
it is only a step further to develop a full-fledged cholera
infantum.</p>

<p>The outcome of any case of summer diarrhea is questionable.
It is not safe to make any promise. An apparently
mild attack may prove quickly fatal. Much
depends upon the previous history of the child. If it
has been a strong, healthy child it has a very good
chance if treated energetically and correctly. If it has
previously suffered from bad nutrition, is not robust,
has had trouble with its stomach, etc., the chances are
against it.</p>

<p>The one lesson to be learned by all mothers is, as
stated above, to act quickly; to be on the watch all
through the summer months for any trouble with the
baby's stomach or bowels. It is much easier to treat
and cure a little trouble than to battle against an established
gastro-enteric intoxication. Overfeeding and indiscriminate
feeding must be religiously avoided,&mdash;they
are the two most prolific causes of stomach and intestinal
troubles in childhood.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;The onset is sudden and pronounced. The
child begins to vomit and continues vomiting and retching
persistently. The bowels are loose, and large,
watery, greenish stools are frequent. The prostration
is very marked, the child looks seriously sick, respiration
is quick and shallow, the eyes sunken, the skin becomes
ashen gray in color, and the pulse is soft and very
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a>]</span>
rapid. The fever may be very high or it may remain
low. The low febrile cases are the worst.</p>

<p>If taken in hand quickly and if the treatment is energetic
and if the child reacts, the case may go rapidly
on to recovery and the child be wholly well in a few
days; or it may not react, but be overwhelmed by the
poison and sink and die in twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;In the treatment of cholera infantum it
must not be forgotten that the dangerous element is
the poisoning of the system that is constantly going on.
It is difficult for the non-medical mind to estimate the
importance of this element. It is, of course, caused by
the bacteria present in the gastro-intestinal canal. There
are numberless millions of bacteria in the normal healthy
bowel. A very large percentage of those germs are good
for us, are there for a beneficent purpose, and can and
do protect us from other germs which occasionally find
their way into the bowel and whose purpose is not a
peaceful one. When the bowel condition changes, as
during an attack of summer diarrhea, it is invaded by
multitudes of evil-intentioned germs. These germs find
conditions in the diseased bowel exceedingly favorable
to them, so they begin work in an active, energetic way.
The result of their activity is highly poisonous, and, as
the good germs are virtually out of business and are
consequently not working in our interest, we are absolutely
in the hands of the enemy. There is soon manufactured,
by these invading germs, enough poison to
poison the entire system of the child. It is this feature
that we must combat in summer diarrhea.</p>

<p>It is absolutely essential to keep these cases as much
in the open fresh air as possible. No matter how sick
they may be, this rule must be observed. Light clothing
is advisable.</p>

<p>If it is a city child that is affected and it does not
show decided improvement in three or four days, it
should, if possible, be sent to the country. There is always
distinct danger of a relapse in every case, so the
little victim should be given a change of air as soon as
convalescence permits. The seashore is preferable to
the mountains in all intestinal cases.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a>]</span></p>

<p>In the care of these patients cleanliness is an important
factor and counts much in the ultimate cure. The
child, as well as the clothing, should be kept scrupulously
clean. Napkins as soon as soiled should be removed and
put into a disinfecting solution. The buttocks should
be well powdered after each movement to prevent sores
developing.</p>

<p>Feeding must be stopped at once. No food of any
kind should be given for at least twenty-four hours, or
until the tendency to vomit subsides. The thirst must
be allayed, however, so we give frequently small quantities
of thin barley water or albumen water or cold boiled
water. If these are vomited we must stop giving them
altogether for twenty-four hours. If the fever is high
and the skin dry, the child should be given a cool pack,
85&deg; to 90&deg; F., which can be moistened every half hour
with water at this temperature; this will often control
the fever satisfactorily. Hot-water bottles should be
placed at the feet if they are cold.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the fever is very low (below
normal), the child's circulation poor, the skin blue and
cold, a hot-water bath at 108&deg; F., for five minutes (rubbing
the surface of the body while in the bath), will be
of very great service. The bath may be repeated at half-hour
intervals.</p>

<p>If the patient is a breast-fed infant it can be allowed
to nurse after the twenty-four-hour rest. The length of
time it is permitted to stay at the breast should be about
one-quarter of the time it was allowed before the attack
began. If it does not vomit, the nursing can be repeated
every four hours. As the case progresses toward recovery
the interval between feedings can be shortened.
Care, however, must be taken not to shorten the interval
too rapidly.</p>

<p>If the patient is artificially fed and is not over four
months old, a substitute for the milk must be found. The
best substitutes are rice or barley water, either plain or
dextrinized, the malted foods, chicken or beef broths,
liquid peptonoids or bovinine. Water (boiled and
cooled) may be allowed at all times if not vomited.</p>

<p>Older children are treated in the same way. All food
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a>]</span>
is withheld while there is any vomiting. When vomiting
stops begin with small quantities of beef broth, or
chicken, or veal broth. Later kumyss or matzoon can
be tried, and finally thin gruels made with milk.</p>

<p>If vomiting persists the stomach must be washed out;
this can be done by giving the infant or child a large
drink of cool boiled water. This will be immediately
vomited and it will clean the stomach at the same time.
The stomach-pump may be used to better advantage.
One washing is usually sufficient. The vomiting will
stop after the stomach has been washed out and the
patient may then be given, frequently, small quantities
of cold albumen water or barley water.</p>

<p>The bowel should be thoroughly cleaned out at the
beginning of every summer diarrhea. Castor oil or calomel
are the two best cathartics for this purpose. If the
stomach is not upset use castor oil. If the stomach is
upset use calomel; one-fourth of a grain every hour
for eight doses will be sufficient. Give enough, however,&mdash;there
is no danger at the beginning of the attack of
too free movements of the bowel. Whatever cathartic is
given, it should produce green, watery stools.</p>

<p>Irrigation of the bowel is an exceedingly effective
way of cleaning out the poison-laden large intestine. It
should be done in every instance unless the movements
are watery and of such frequency as to render irrigation
unnecessary. Once or twice daily will be sufficient
in even the worst cases. The irrigation should be given
at the temperature of 100&deg; F, and should be the normal
saline solution; a long rectal tube is used to give the
irrigation.</p>

<h4>COLIC</h4>

<p>Colic is a common condition in infancy. Very few
children escape more or less colic during the first few
months of life. It does not seem to injure permanently
some infants; they go on growing according to standard,
eat and sleep, and seem contented and happy despite
occasional severe attacks of colic. Other children suffer
seriously; the degree of indigestion is considerable, and
the nutrition of the child is interfered with.</p>

<p>Colic is much more frequent in bottle-fed infants than
in those fed on breast milk. Cow's milk, no matter
how skillfully it is prepared for their use, is at best an
unsuitable diet and taxes the digestive ability of robust
children. It is quite natural for an infant whose digestive
organs are not strong to develop colic and intestinal
indigestion if put on artificial food. Any condition
that causes indigestion may likewise cause colic.
Those children who are always overfeeding,&mdash;taking too
much milk, too strong milk, or who are fed irregularly,&mdash;are
the colicky babies.</p>

<p>Constipation is frequently associated with colic and
may be the actual cause. A daily movement of the
bowel does not necessarily mean that the bowels are
emptying themselves satisfactorily. Despite the daily
movement, there may be considerable fecal matter left in
the bowel which undergoes decomposition. This results
in the evolution of large quantities of gas and severe attacks
of colic. Indigestion is very often caused by
conditions which effect the stability of the child's nervous
organism; such conditions are fright, anger, fatigue,
exhaustion, excitement.</p>

<p>The origin of the colic in breast-fed children is very
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a>]</span>
often caused by some nervous condition of the mother
that affects her milk. Constipation in the mother may
cause colic in the child.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;A baby having an attack of colic will
cry loudly from time to time and whine during the interval;
it will pull up its legs and bear down. Its abdomen
is tense and hard and distended with gas. With
the expulsion of the gas the pain ceases and the child
falls asleep. If the attack is very severe the prostration
and exhaustion is marked; the feet are cold and the
body is bathed in perspiration.</p>

<p>If the colic is constant the child may be fretful and
restless most of the time, being seemingly comfortable
for only an hour or two in the twenty-four.</p>

<p>In older children who cry because of severe pain
in the abdomen the possibility of appendicitis must not
be forgotten.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Find out the cause of the colic if possible.
If the cause is located in the mother, the remedy
naturally must affect her. Regulation of her bowel, restriction
of her diet, and proper exercise, may be sufficient
to effect a cure of the colic in the infant.</p>

<p>The object of treatment is to help the child get rid
of the gas. The best and quickest means to effect this
is to apply massage or give a rectal injection. An injection
of two ounces of cold water in which a half or one
teaspoonful of glycerine has been put, will act quickly.
Dry heat applied to the abdomen in the form of the
hot-water bottle or woolen cloths will aid in the expulsion
of the gas. The feet should be kept warm.</p>

<p>In cases of habitual colic in breast-fed babies the
cause may be in the quality of the mother's milk. It
should be examined and if found too strong should be
diluted. This can be done by giving the child an ounce
of plain boiled water or barley water before each feeding.
If the child gets an ounce of liquid before each
feeding he will not want as much of the breast milk; so
we shall have the same total quantity, but a reduced
quality, which may cure the colic at once.</p>

<p>It is necessary, in order to cure colic, that the bowels
move every day in a satisfactory manner. If any aid
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a>]</span>
is needed, milk of magnesia is the best laxative. It
may be given in teaspoonful doses in water previous to
a feeding. Aromatic cascara sagrada in from ten to
thirty-drop doses is a very good laxative, if a stronger
remedy is needed.</p>

<p>To relieve the acute attack, three drops of Hoffman's
anodyne may be given in two teaspoonfuls of warm
water and repeated in ten-minute intervals until relieved,
to a baby under one year of age. From five
to ten drops of gin, given in three teaspoonfuls of
warm water, and repeated in fifteen minutes, is also
satisfactory and harmless. A very good remedy which
may be used with the above for quick relief, and to
stop the child from crying, is the following: Fold a
piece of flannel cloth (two thicknesses) the size of the
baby's abdomen; wring out of very hot water and drop
ten drops of turpentine over the surface,&mdash;at different
spots,&mdash;of the flannel and lay on abdomen,&mdash;turpentine
side next skin. Cover this with another piece of flannel,&mdash;two
or three thicknesses, that has been dry-heated and
allow to remain in place for about ten minutes.</p>

<p>Colic, as a rule, disappears completely about the third
month.</p>


<h4>APPENDICITIS</h4>

<p>Appendicitis is mentioned here merely to acquaint
mothers with its prominent symptoms.</p>

<p>When a child has what seems to be an attack of indigestion,
but complains of pain and tenderness in the
abdomen, vomits, and develops a fever, and is constipated,
appendicitis may be suspected.</p>

<p>The pain and tenderness are not referred to the region
of the appendix but are more centrally located.
If, however, the finger point is pressed over the appendix,
distinct tenderness will be elicited in inflammation
of that region. Constipation is the rule in appendicitis,
but diarrhea occasionally accompanies it.</p>

<p>The abdominal muscles may be rigid, that is, the abdomen
does not feel soft as is usual; there is a feeling
if they are pressed, as if they were hard and unyielding.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Put the child in bed and send for the
family physician at once. The condition is too serious
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a>]</span>
and too uncertain to delay, or for a parent to make any
effort at treatment. Appendicitis is a much more serious
condition in infancy and childhood than it is in
an adult.</p>


<h4>JAUNDICE IN INFANTS</h4>

<p>There are two types of jaundice in infants that deserve
brief consideration.</p>

<p>1st. There is a form of jaundice caused by a defect in
the development of the bile or gall tubes. These infants
develop jaundice a day or two after birth and become
intensely jaundiced within a very brief time. They
lose flesh and strength to a marked degree and die in a
few weeks. It is not possible to affect this condition
favorably by any method of treatment. This type of
jaundice is not very common.</p>

<p>2nd. There is a type of jaundice that appears between
the second and fifth day of life that is very
common. It lasts from one to two weeks and then disappears.
It is never fatal and is not serious. It requires
no treatment.</p>


<h4>JAUNDICE IN OLDER CHILDREN&mdash;CATARRHAL
JAUNDICE&mdash;GASTRO DUODENITIS</h4>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;This form of jaundice begins like an attack
of ordinary indigestion. There are, as a rule, pain,
fever, vomiting, and prostration. The pain is located
in the upper part of the abdomen and may be quite
severe. The vomiting may continue for a number of
days. The bowels are usually constipated. After a
few days the jaundice sets in and may be quite intense.
After the jaundice is established the stools are gray
or white in color and there is much gas in the bowel.
The urine is very dark and may be yellow or yellowish-green
in color. The child complains of headache, is
dull and listless, and appears sick and weak. The condition
lasts about two weeks, but the jaundice may last
much longer. It is not a serious disease.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The diet should be cut down in quantity
and should consist of rare meat, fruit, and a small
quantity of milk. If vomiting continues the milk may
diluted with lime water or vichy water. The child
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a>]</span>
should drink water or vichy water freely. No starchy
foods, or fats, or sugars should be allowed. The bowels
should be kept open with calomel, one-tenth of a grain
every hour until ten are taken, to be followed by citrate
of magnesia every morning. If the pain is severe it may
be relieved by a mustard paste or a turpentine poultice.
The child should be given acid hydrochloric diluted,
eight drops in one-half glass of water, ten minutes before
each meal&mdash;and kept on it for at least one month.</p>


<h4>INTESTINAL WORMS</h4>

<p>There are three types of intestinal worms; they are
known as the round-worm, the thread-worm, and the
tape worm.</p>

<p><b>Round-Worm</b>.&mdash;The round-worm is usually found in
children of the run-about age. It is never seen in
infancy. It occupies the small or upper intestine, and
is from four to ten inches long. If there are round-worms
in the bowel, there are usually a number of
them and there may be hundreds.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;Round-worms give no definite symptoms.
The only possible way to tell if they are present is
actually to see them in the stools of the child. They
are of a light gray color.</p>

<p>It is reasonable to expect that a child suffering from
worms will have symptoms of abdominal distress from
time to time; indigestion with colic and much gas may
be present; children lose their appetites and are nervous
and restless; sleep is disturbed; they may grind
their teeth and talk in their sleep, and they may pick
their noses unnecessarily during the day. These symptoms
may, however, accompany other conditions when
no worms are present in the bowel. My observation has
been that in children in whom worms were present the
nervous symptoms were distinctly accentuated. They
are unreliable children; they seem well to-day and
peevish to-morrow; they complain of headaches,
dizziness, and chilly feelings. They are hysterical, noisy,
uncontrollable. A child with these symptoms should
be suspected of having worms and if no cause can be
found to explain his temperamental vagaries he should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
be treated for worms. I have cured a number of children
of excessive nervousness by giving them medicine
for worms when no worms were present. Such results
can only be explained on the assumption that
these children were suffering from intestinal auto-toxemia
or self-poisoning, and the thorough disinfection
of the bowel apparently stopped the process by ridding
the child's system of a mass of bacteria, which were
undoubtedly causing the auto-toxemia and consequent
nervousness.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The most efficient remedy for removing
round-worms is Santonin. The quantity necessary for
the various ages is as follows:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Two to four years</td><td align='left'>2</td>
<td align='left'>grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Four to six years</td><td align='left'>3</td>
<td align='left'>grains.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Six to ten years</td><td align='left'>3-1/2</td>
<td align='left'> grains.</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The best way to give it is in divided doses, with an
equal quantity of sugar of milk. For a child of six
years the formula would therefore be, 3-1/2 grains of
Santonin, mixed with the same quantity of sugar of
milk divided into three powders. These powders are
given four hours apart in the following way. The
child is given a light supper the evening before and one-half
glass citrate of magnesia the following morning and
the first powder one-half hour later; no breakfast being
given. A light lunch, of milk and crackers, may be
taken about noon. The second powder is given four
hours after the first, and the third four hours after
the second. Half an hour after the last powder, a dose
of castor oil (one tablespoonful) is given. In a few
moments the bowels will move; usually there are no
worms in this movement. A little later they will move
freely again and if worms are present they will be discharged
in this movement.</p>

<p><b>Thread-Worm, or Pin-Worm</b>.&mdash;A thread-worm looks
just like a little piece of white thread. They are found
in the lower part of the bowel and in the rectum. They
are usually present, if present at all, in large numbers.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;The chief symptom is itching. It may
be limited to the anus or it may involve the neighboring
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a>]</span>
parts. Thread-worms may find their way out of the
anus and in female children may find their way into the
vagina. In these instances the child is tormented with
itching of the privates and may establish the habit of
self-abuse as a result of the constant itching and scratching.
The itching is more intense at night soon after the
child goes to bed. As a result of the local irritation in
the lower part of the bowel and rectum there is set up a
catarrh of the bowel which produces large quantities of
mucus.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The only medication by the mouth that
is of any use is turpentine in one drop doses after meals,
given in a teaspoonful of sugar. The best treatment,
and in most cases the only treatment that is effective,
is the use of rectal injections. The procedure is as follows:&mdash;The
child first gets a cleaning injection of two
quarts of warm water into which a teaspoonful of
borax has been put. This will wash away any mucus
or fecal matter that may have collected. This injection
is best given with a No. 18 rectal catheter which is
pushed into the rectum for about 10 inches, the water
being allowed to run away as it enters. From six to
eight ounces of the infusion of quassia is then passed,
as high up as the catheter will reach. It is intended
that the quassia will remain in as long as possible, for
at least half an hour. In order to assure this there are
two features that should be kept in mind: first, the
water should be allowed to flow in slowly, consequently
hold the bag low, not higher than two feet above the
level of the bed on which the patient lies; second, after
the water is all in remove the catheter very slowly and
keep the child absolutely quiet. This treatment is repeated
every second night for a week, then twice a
week for four weeks.</p>

<p>A solution of garlic is a very effective remedy and
may be tried if the quassia fails, which is not likely if
the treatment is carried out effectively and if the parts
are kept scrupulously clean.</p>

<p><b>Tape Worms</b>.&mdash;Tape worms are obtained from eating
raw meat, pork or sausage, rarely from fish, and from
playing with cats and dogs.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;No definite symptoms accompany the
presence of tape worm. The children may have pains
in the abdomen, diarrhea, a capricious appetite, foul
breath, and they may suffer from anemia, sometimes
quite severely. The only positive symptoms is the presence
of links of the worm in the stools.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Give a dose of castor oil at bed time.
Two hours after breakfast next morning give one-half
dram of the oleoresin of male-fern in emulsion or capsule.
Very light nourishment should be taken during the
day, composed of gruels and soups. When the worm is
passed it should be examined to find if the head is
present; if not, the treatment should be repeated in
twenty-four hours.</p>


<h4>RUPTURE</h4>

<p>Rupture of any description is not a condition that
any mother should attempt to treat. A physician should
be called in every case. Any misdirected effort at manipulation
or pressure may result in irreparable injury to
the parts. External applications are useless and may
be injurious.</p>

<p>All ordinary forms of rupture in infancy and early
childhood are curable if properly treated.

<h3>DISEASES OF CHILDREN, CONTINUED</h3>

<div class="blockquot">Mastitis or Inflammation of the Breasts in

Anemia&mdash;Pernicious Anemia<br /></div>


<h4>MASTITIS, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE BREASTS
IN INFANCY</h4>

<p>There are a few drops of a milky secretion in the
breasts of infants when born. Occasionally the amount
will be in excess of the normal quantity, and the breasts,
around the nipple, may be swollen and slightly inflamed.
Should this condition persist, it may be relieved by painting
the parts with the tincture of belladonna. Under no
circumstances should the breasts be manipulated or
rubbed, as this is very apt to cause an inflammatory condition,
and to result in mastitis.</p>

<p>Mastitis begins, as a rule, during the second week of
life. The breast becomes red, swollen, painful, and
shows inflammatory changes. It may terminate without
the formation of an abscess, or it may go on to suppuration.
The child becomes extremely restless and irritable,
it is disinclined to nurse, and suffers from loss of sleep
and nourishment. It is possible for such a condition, in
the female, to injure the breast to the extent of arresting
its development and to render it useless in the future. If
the suppuration is extensive the process may terminate
fatally.</p>

<p>Mastitis in infants is caused by unnecessary interference
and manipulation and by want of cleanliness.
When it occurs the parts should be kept absolutely clean
and should not be handled in any way. Ichthyol 25 per
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a>]</span>
cent., Zinc Oxide Ointment, enough to make one ounce,
spread upon old, clean, soft linen, and laid over the parts
and changed every six hours, is an excellent healing application.
A piece of oiled silk may be put outside the
linen to prevent the ointment staining the clothing, and
over this a layer of absorbent cotton and a binder, applied
without pressure.</p>

<p>If an abscess develops in spite of treatment, it must be
freely opened and freely drained, and the general health
of the patient supported by regular nourishment and
tonics.</p>

<p><b>Mastitis in Young Girls</b>.&mdash;Pain and swelling of the
breasts are sometimes complained of by girls between the
twelfth and fifteenth years, though it may occur at an
earlier or later date. If left alone the condition will invariably
subside without treatment. Should bacteria find
an entrance through the nipple at this time, an abscess
may result. The whole breast is involved and it will be
exceedingly painful and much swollen. There may be
moderate fever, headache, and a pronounced feeling of
indisposition. These patients should be given a laxative,&mdash;citrate
of magnesia, or Pluto Water, and kept on a
very light diet. An ice-bag should be kept constantly
at the breast during the day, and a moist dressing of
1:5000 bichloride of mercury during the night.</p>

<p>It may take a week before recovery takes place.</p>


<h4>LET YOUR EARS ALONE</h4>

<p><b>Never Box a Child's Ears</b>.&mdash;A single blow may make
a child deaf; repeated blows on their ears will certainly
injure children's hearing.</p>

<p>Thomas A. Edison, our greatest inventor, was made
deaf when a lad by a surly brakeman, who soundly boxed
his ears for some trivial or fancied offense.</p>

<p>Boxing a child's ears is but one of a great many things
you should never do to the ears. In fact, there are far
more things you should not do to safeguard the hearing,
than there are things you can do to benefit your ears.</p>

<p><b>Do Not Pick the Ears</b>.&mdash;Do not put cotton in the ears
unless ordered to do so by a reputable physician. Do not
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a>]</span>
syringe the ears without the doctor's orders. Put no
poultices in the ears. Do not put drops of any kind in
the ears unless prescribed by a doctor. Above all, do not
use the advertised ear cures, as most of them are harmful.
Never blow into a child's ear, never douche the nose
without the doctor's orders, as this may wash germs into
the tubes leading to the ears and bring about a serious
condition.</p>

<p>Riding in tunnels, especially in tunnels under water
where the air pressure varies, has, through some recent
investigation, been found to be injurious to the ears of a
great many people.</p>

<p>Conductors and other trainmen who run through many
tunnels are apt to have ear trouble, as are the men who
work underground a great depth where they are in motion,
such as miners running underground trains.</p>

<p>If you have an earache that continues for any length
of time, take no chances, but consult a physician. And
remember to care for the throat and nose, as ill conditions
in those places result in ear troubles. Do not blow
your nose too hard; it merely injures the inner sides of
the ear drums. Adenoids in children frequently bring
about a bad ear trouble. Even seasickness is due in a
great measure to ear disturbances.</p>

<p>If you have a running ear, attend to it at once by visiting
a doctor. So serious is this that life insurance companies
will not insure people in that condition.</p>

<p><b>Earache</b>.&mdash;When a child complains of earache its ear
should be examined. In nearly every case of earache it
is necessary to treat the throat, as this is, as a rule, the
seat of the trouble. An antiseptic gargle of equal parts
of Borolyptol and warm water is an excellent mixture. It
should be used freely every two hours. Children suffering
from earache should be kept indoors. If the examination
should show that it is not necessary to lance the
ear drum, some local measure may be adopted to allay the
pain. Putting the child in bed with the head resting on
a hot-water bottle may be all that will be necessary. The
following procedure may be carried out, but only after a
physician has made an examination and according to his
directions: A hot water douche, given by means of a
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a>]</span>
douche bag, is quite effective. The water should be 110&deg;
F.; the bag should be held about two feet above the level
of the child's head, and the irrigating point should not be
pushed into the ear, but held so that the water will find
its own way into the ear.</p>

<p>When the earache does not respond to the above
methods the ear should be closely watched and examined
at intervals so that it may be opened at the right moment.
This is very essential because, if it is neglected, the pus
may find its way into the mastoid cells and set up the
dangerous disease, mastoiditis. This disease may cause
abscess of the brain and death. The moment a child develops
fever in the course of an earache the ear should be
examined and opened at once, if found necessary.</p>

<p><b>Inflammation of the Ear. Acute Otitis</b>.&mdash;Inflammation
of the ear seldom occurs in childhood, unless as a
complication, or as a result of some infectious disease.
Any disease which affects the throat in any way may be
the cause of the inflammation of the ear. Such diseases
are, "cold in the head," tonsilitis, grippe, "sore throat," or
pharyngitis, measles, scarlet fever. It is much more common
in children than in adults. The younger the child,
the more liable it is to develop ear trouble when suffering
from any of the above diseases. The presence of adenoids
favors the development of ear complications.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;There is one symptom present in all cases
of inflammation of the ear; that is, fever. Pain may or
may not be present; it is present in a majority of the
cases. Children with inflammation of the ear are exceedingly
restless and do not sleep long at a time nor do they
sleep soundly.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The treatment is to open the drum membrane,
at the right time, which of course will always be
done by a physician who has had some experience in this
work.</p>

<p><b>After Treatment</b>.&mdash;The after treatment consists of
washing or syringing the ear every three hours with
eight or twelve ounces of a 1:10,000 solution of corrosive
sublimate. This will be kept up for four days; then the
intervals between the washing will be extended to five
hours, and kept up until the drum membrane closes. If
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a>]</span>
the corrosive sublimate solution should cause any eruption
around the ear, a normal salt solution (see page <a href="#Page_627">
627</a>) may be used in the same way, and in the same quantity as
above. A running ear will run for from three to six
weeks. It may heal up at any time after ten days. If the
discharge should suddenly stop and the fever rise, it
indicates that the opening has become plugged or healed
too quickly. In either case it will have to be opened
again. As soon as the ear begins running again the
symptoms will disappear. After syringing the ear it
should be dried thoroughly with pieces of sterile absorbent
cotton.</p>

<p>The best syringe to use for washing out the ear is a
one-ounce hard-rubber ear syringe with a soft rubber tip.
An ordinary douche bag will do if a syringe of the above
character cannot be obtained. The douche bag should not
be held higher than two feet above the patient's head.
The double-current ear irrigator is an excellent device
for this purpose. The child should be on its back on a
table. Its arms should be fastened down by its side. A
basin can be placed under its ear and the irrigating done
without causing any pain or discomfort.</p>

<p>Any child addicted to disease of the ear should be
closely watched and examined for tuberculosis. Scrofula
may accompany this condition. These children need
careful attention in every little detail, they need good
nourishment, fresh air night and day, and they should
not be pushed at school. During the winter they should
be protected from "catching colds;" it is a good plan to
put them on a cod-liver-oil mixture for the entire cold
season. During the summer they should have a radical
change of climate.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY:</b></p>

<blockquote><p>1st. Inflammation of the ear is frequently a complication
of or follows some other disease which affects
the throat.</p>

<p>2nd. If a child with one of these diseases becomes restless,
sleepless and feverish, be on the look-out for ear
trouble.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a>]</span></p>

<p>3rd. The ear must be lanced immediately when necessary.</p>

<p>4th. The after treatment is very important, because the
hearing of the child depends upon it.</p></blockquote>


<h4>SWOLLEN GLANDS. ACUTE ADENITIS</h4>

<p>Swollen glands in infancy and childhood are usually
seen below and behind the ear, less frequently in the
groin. Their cause is, as a rule, local disturbance in the
mouth or throat, as decayed teeth, enlarged tonsils, cold
in the head, catarrh, adenoids, or some form of infection
of the mouth, or throat, or scalp. They occasionally accompany
scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, and influenza.
They seldom suppurate.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;A swelling is noticed just below the angle
of the jaw; it does not grow rapidly. There is a slight
temperature and the child is more or less irritable. If
the patient is an infant, the fever may be quite high and
there may be considerable prostration. The trouble lasts
from four to eight weeks.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;An ice-bag constantly applied is the best
treatment. This not only relieves pain, but it prevents the
possibility of the gland breaking down and suppurating.
It is sometimes difficult to keep an ice-bag on an infant,
in which case cold compresses should be applied. These
are made by taking several layers of old linen or cheese
cloth and laying them on ice. They should be applied frequently
to the swollen gland. The following ointment
may be applied, though the ice-bag is the better and more
certain treatment: Ichthyol 25 per cent., Adeps Lanae
one ounce. This is applied on cloth and renewed every
six hours.</p>

<p>This ointment is black and stains the clothing. For
that reason it is advised to use oiled silk over the cloth to
avoid staining the pillow or clothing.</p>

<p>Children suffering from adenitis should use a spray of
Dobell's solution in the nose and throat three or four
times daily. If the cause of the swollen glands is known,
treatment for its cure should be promptly instituted.</p>

<p>In the event of pus forming the gland must be opened
and drained.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a>]</span></p>

<p>Swollen glands in the groin of a child are caused most
frequently by some inflammatory condition of the
privates, which should be discovered and treated.</p>


<h4>BOILS</h4>

<p>In some delicate children and in some children who do
not seem to be delicate, repeated crops of boils may appear
from time to time.</p>

<p>It is necessary to open them as soon as pus is present.
They should be pressed out and a gauze dressing, wet
with a saturated solution of boric acid, bound over them.
The dressing should be kept moist.</p>

<p>I have in a number of instances successfully rid a child
of the tendency to boils by the use of the following
formula, which I can recommend highly as one of the
best tonics I have ever used in the treatment of delicate
and poorly nourished children: Tinct. Nux Vomica 4
drops, Acid Phosphoric Dilute 8 drops, Syrup Hypophosphites,
1 teaspoonful. Make a two-ounce mixture and
give to children over four years of age one teaspoonful
after each meal; to younger children, one-half teaspoonful
after each meal.</p>

<p>It is necessary in these cases to keep the bowels open
daily.</p>


<h4>HIVES. NETTLE-RASH</h4>

<p><b>Cause</b>.&mdash;Contact with different plants, bites of insects,
irritation from clothing, use of certain drugs. Certain
articles of food, such as tomatoes, strawberries, oatmeal,
buckwheat, have all been said to cause hives.</p>

<p>Dentition during warm weather and the presence of
worms and chronic malarial poisoning have been known
to cause hives.</p>

<p>It is most frequently caused, however, in childhood
by some disturbance in the stomach or bowels.</p>

<p>It causes severe itching and loss of sleep and as a
result of these the general health suffers.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;If caused by any external irritant, remove
it. If it is caused by any special article of diet, prohibit
its use. If no cause is apparent, give the child one tablespoonful
of castor oil, and put it on the mildest diet possible
of soups, broths, and dried stale bread. Give no
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a>]</span>
milk. Use the following treatment on the erupted parts:
Menthol, ten grains in one ounce of cold cream. Keep
the bowels open.</p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to advise a change of air
before complete cure results.</p>


<h4>PRICKLY HEAT</h4>

<p>This is a very common complaint in children during
the summer months. It is so common that it is well
known and easily recognized. It consists of a bright red
eruption, composed of little papules, close together.</p>

<p>The rash comes out quickly, so much so that mothers
may be surprised and frightened by observing an angry
looking rash on their baby some morning when none
was there the night before. It most frequently appears
upon the neck, back, chest, and forehead. It is exceedingly
itchy and a child may scratch itself and cause extensive
harm. Eczema, of a very obstinate type, frequently
results from scratching.</p>

<p>The rash of prickly heat is easily diagnosed from other
rashes because it is accompanied by no other symptom,
such as fever, which would suggest a more serious disease.
The rash of prickly heat resembles the rash of
scarlet fever more than any other rash, but it is quickly
noted that when a child has scarlet fever it has every
symptom of being profoundly sick, while prickly heat
has no symptom other than the itch and discomfort. It
is caused by overfeeding, being overclothed, and sweating
in hot weather.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Steps should be taken to prevent prickly
heat in an infant. Use light, seasonable clothing, bathe
frequently, and use plenty of good toilet powder. When
the child actually has an attack, open its bowels freely
with citrate of magnesia, and give some sweet spirits of
niter, according to age. Protect the skin from the irritating
underwear by interposing a soft piece of linen.
In order to reduce the inflammation and cure the condition
apply equal parts of starch and boric acid powder
freely. Keep the patient on a light fluid diet. The bran
bath is advisable if the little patient is addicted to these
skin eruptions.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a>]</span></p>


<h4>RINGWORM OF THE SCALP</h4>

<p>Children of all ages are liable to "catch" ringworm
of the scalp. It particularly affects those who are untidy,
dirty, and badly cared for, though any child is apt to get
it while attending the public schools.</p>

<p>If a mother discovers scaly patches in the scalp, with
loss of hair, ringworm should be immediately suspected.
It is not, however, always easy to diagnose the condition,
especially if the case is a mild one. If it is a severe attack,
there is, as a rule, quite a little inflammation, and
this may render the condition obscure for some time.
The disease may be mistaken for dandruff, but dandruff
covers a large area of the scalp, while ringworm is limited
and sharply defined. Dandruff may cause a loss of
hair; if it does, the hairs come out clean, while in ringworm
they break off near the scalp.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Ringworm is always curable, provided
the patient is watched and treatment carried out thoroughly.
It is always absolutely necessary to treat the
condition, because it will not get better of itself, and
the longer it is permitted to last, the worse it gets, and
the more difficult it is to cure. If treatment is begun at
once, it may take two months to cure it. If the case has
lasted for some time, or if it has been neglected and not
treated thoroughly, it will take from six months to one
year to cure it. These facts are stated so that parents
may not become discouraged.</p>

<p>The first thing to do is to cut the hair as close to the
scalp as possible, wherever the ringworm is, and for
about an inch outside, and all around it. The entire
scalp should be thoroughly washed three times a week.
The scales should be kept soft by the use of carbolic
soap.</p>

<p>The hair should not be brushed at all, because brushing
the hair may spread the disease to other parts of the scalp.
Every child with ringworm of the scalp should wear a
cap of muslin or one lined with paper, so that others
may not be infected. These caps can be burned when
dirty and new ones made. One of the best remedies to
apply to the affected area is the following: Bichloride
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a>]</span>
of mercury, 2 grains; olive oil, 2 teaspoonfuls; kerosene,
2 teaspoonfuls. This is rubbed in every day until the
parts are sore and tender. It is a good plan to apply
this mixture to the entire scalp every fourth day, to guard
against other parts becoming infected. It is not necessary
to rub it in when using it where there is no ringworm.</p>

<p>When the scalp becomes sore from the application it
can be stopped for a day or two, or until better; then
begin again and repeat the treatment right along. If
the kerosene in the above mixture is objected to, a very
good mixture is bichloride of mercury, 2 grains, and
tincture of iodine, 1 ounce. This may be rubbed vigorously
enough to produce a rash. If the disease shows a
tendency to spread under this treatment it is best to
apply the latter mixture to the entire scalp.</p>

<p>Ringworm on any other part of the body is effectually
treated by applying tincture of iodine. It should be
painted on every day until the skin begins to peel, when
the ringworm will disappear with the skin.</p>


<h4>ECZEMA</h4>

<p>Eczema is the most important skin disease of babyhood.
It is probably the most frequent skin disease of
infancy. Any baby may develop eczema. There are,
however, some babies who seem to be very susceptible
to it. The reason of this susceptibility seems to be due
to the natural tenderness, or delicacy, of the skin. These
children, because of the extreme sensitiveness of the skin,
develop an eczema from a very slight degree of external
irritation, or a trifling disturbance of digestion. Children
of rheumatic or gouty parents are more liable to
be victims of eczema than are others. Eczema of the
face is quite common in children who are apparently
healthy and fat. It does not seem to matter whether
they are breast-fed or bottle-fed. The following conditions
may be regarded as contributory to eczema:</p>

<p>Exposure to winds; cold, dry air; heat; the use of
hard water or strong soaps; lack of cleanliness, and the
irritation of clothing. It frequently accompanies chronic
constipation, indigestion, and other conditions of the
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a>]</span>
intestinal canal; overfeeding; too early or too excessive use
of starchy foods.</p>

<p><b>Eczema of the Face:&mdash;Eczema Rubrum</b>.&mdash;This is the
most frequent form. It affects the cheeks, scalp, forehead,
and sometimes the ears and the neck. It begins
on the cheeks as small red papules. These join together
and form a mass of moist, exuding crusts. They dry in
time and may be so thick as to form a mask on the face.
The skin may be much swollen. When the crusts are
removed the face looks red and angry and bleeds easily.
It is exceedingly itchy. It causes restlessness, loss of
sleep, and it may affect the appetite, though, as a rule,
the health remains good. Eczema of the face is exceedingly
chronic; it improves from time to time, but it is
cured with great difficulty only.</p>

<p>Infants suffering with eczema of the face begin to
improve about the middle of the second year and may
be entirely cured about this time. The reason of this
is the greater amount of exercise the child is getting
at this period. If the disease continues longer it is
because of the unnecessary amount of fat that the child
has.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Eczema is a notoriously tedious disease.
There is very little tendency for it to improve, if
left to itself. The age, the severity, and just how much
you can rely upon the mother, or nurse, faithfully to carry
out directions&mdash;upon these its cure depends. At best, the
treatment may have to be carried out for months. If the
eczema is accompanied with constipation and indigestion
in infancy, very little can be done with the eczema until
these conditions are removed.</p>

<p>There exists in the minds of the laity, and in some
physicians also, an idea that it is wrong, or dangerous,
to cure, or "dry up," an eczema. It is never dangerous,
but highly desirable, to cure an eczema, whenever possible.
It is always wise, because it is always necessary,
to get the child in perfect condition before you treat
the eczema. Cure the constipation, or indigestion, or
cold, or whatever is the matter with the child; then treat
the eczema. This is the only plan that offers any success.
It is not a simple matter to find out why a nursing child
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a>]</span>
is having indigestion. The most minute care must be
exercised to find out the element in the milk that is causing
the eczema. It would, however, be foolish, and a
waste of time, to apply pastes, etc., to an eczema of the
face, while the real cause that produced it was still in existence.
It will frequently be found necessary to change
the food entirely. Strict attention to the bowels is essential,
both in infants and in older children. Sometimes to
cure the constipation means an immediate cure of the
eczema.</p>

<p>If the child is anemic, poorly nourished, and flabby,
tonics are advisable. Cod liver oil is of use in quite a
number of these cases. Eczematous children should not
be taken out when the weather is very cold or when there
are high winds. They should not be washed with plain
water, or with castile soap and water. When washing
is necessary, do it with milk and water, to which one
teaspoonful of borax is added. The clothing must not
be too heavy.</p>

<p>In eczema of the face, the child must either wear a
mask or heavy woolen gloves, so that he will not scratch
the parts. Frequently these fail, and it will be necessary
to restrain the child from scratching the face by the
use of some mechanical device. A piece of strong pasteboard
bandaged on the elbows, so as to prevent the child
from bending them, is all that is necessary. If the child
cannot bend the elbows he cannot scratch his face, yet
he has the free use of his hands.</p>

<p>The use of external remedies is imperative, as frequently
the cause is mostly external, and in other cases
it must be used in addition to the general treatment.
Before external treatment is instituted, the crusts should
be softened by applying olive oil to them for twenty-four
hours, after which they can be removed with soap
and water. If there is much inflammation, or if the face
looks angry, a very good application is Lassar's paste.</p>

<p>Later, when the inflammation has subsided and the
itching is severe, a mixture of tar ointment, 3 teaspoonfuls;
zinc oxide, 1-1/2 teaspoonfuls; rose water ointment,
6 teaspoonfuls has proved to be one of the very best.</p>

<p>When the eczema on the face is of the weeping, or
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a>]</span>
moist, variety, the application of bassorin paste gives
splendid results.</p>

<p>When an external remedy is applied to any eczematous
surface it is necessary to apply it on a cloth. Simply to
smear it on will do no good.</p>

<p>In the treatment of eczema, when the children are
breast-fed, it is well to remember that the real cause
of the eczema may be in the mother. If the mother is
constipated, or if her diet is too liberal, if she is drinking
beer, or an excess of coffee, or is not taking exercise, the
eczema may be caused by one or other or all of these.</p>

<p>For eczema of the scalp the remedy to use is white-precipitate
ointment, 1 part; vaseline, 4 parts. Mix
together and apply.</p>


<h4>POOR BLOOD. SIMPLE ANEMIA</h4>

<p><b>Causes</b>.&mdash;There is what may be termed an unnatural
tendency toward poor blood during infancy and childhood.
The explanation of this anomalous condition is,
that the tax or strain put upon the blood to provide for
the growth of the child is severe, and is in addition to
the great demands made upon it in the exercise of its
regular duties. We must, therefore, always take this
special duty into consideration, when the question of recuperation,
convalescence, feeding, and the administration
of blood foods and tonics comes up.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to specify the diseases from which
a child may suffer and recover, in an anemic condition.
Any disease may leave a child with temporarily poor
blood. The conditions which most frequently produce
anemia in childhood are improper feeding and unhealthy
surroundings. It is not fully appreciated how seriously
these conditions can affect the health of growing children.
There is one condition that every mother should be
warned against, namely, the possibility of unduly prolonging
breast-feeding. Children should be weaned at the end
of the tenth month. By prolonging the breast-feeding a
mother can undermine the vitality and strength of her
baby and so impoverish its blood as to invite disease. A
bottle-fed baby should be put upon a mixed diet at the
same time. To continue feeding a child exclusively on
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a>]</span>
milk for a year or two after weaning, simply because "it
will not take anything else," is criminal. Any woman
guilty of such stupidity should never have become a
mother. Once again it must be emphasized that every
child must have an abundance of fresh air, must not be
confined in close, hot, unsanitary rooms, and must have
a daily, satisfactory movement of the bowels to be a
healthy child with good blood in its body.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;Children suffering from poor blood are
flabby, constipated, hungry, weak specimens of childhood.
They are under weight, complain of headache, pains,
disturbed sleep, are nervous and irritable. They tire
quickly, are short of breath, and may have a tendency to
faint easily. The hands and feet are cold, the pulse is
small and irregular. They may have attacks of nose-bleeding
and of bed-wetting.</p>

<p><b>Chlorosis</b>.&mdash;Chlorosis is that form of anemia, of poor
blood, which occurs in young girls about the time their
sickness begins. It is most frequently seen between the
fourteenth and seventeenth years, and more often in
blondes than in brunettes. The cause is not known. It
is thought to be due to constipation. Any occupation
which is deleterious to health has a distinct influence on
the condition. Employment in factories, confinement in
badly ventilated rooms, bad or insufficient food, great
grief, care, or a bad fright, mental strain, overstudy, may
all produce, or contribute to the production of chlorosis.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;The symptoms of chlorosis resemble
those of simple anemia. Children suffering from anemia
are pale; girls with chlorosis have a peculiar greenish
yellow tint in the skin. They are short of breath, they
have vertigo, palpitation, disturbances of digestion, constipation,
cold hands and feet, and scanty or arrested
monthly periods. They have various nervous disturbances,
such as headache, pains in various parts of the
body, neuralgia, especially over the eyes, hysterical attacks,
and sometimes cholera. Ulcer of the stomach is
sometimes seen in this condition.</p>

<p>The disease lasts for a year or longer; it frequently
lasts a number of years. Relapses are frequent.</p>

<div class="center">&quot;A Misfortune at Birth&quot;</div>

<p>Warren is feeble-minded. His family said it was due to &quot;a serious
fall of the mother.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="#Footnote_A_2">[A]</a>
"The family history is, however, exceedingly interesting.</p>

<p>"The paternal grandfather, whom we have called Nick, was of good family,
although he himself was totally different from the rest. He was weak in every
way, and to be considered feeble-minded. He married into a family that was
much lower socially than his own, although we have no proof that it was a
defective family. The children of this couple were all mentally defective and
low-grade, morally as well as intellectually.</p>

<p>"Warren's father, Jake, a thoroughly disgraceful character, married Sal, a
woman somewhat older than he.</p>

<p>"The immorality of this family beggars description. A girl named Moll was
fifteen years old when Jake brought her into his home: his wife, Sal, was so
feeble-minded that she allowed the illicit relations between these two. Moll's
child was born in the hospital after the mother had been sent away from one
Home because of her horrible syphilitic condition&mdash;from which she finally
died.</p>

<p>"Our boy Warren's sister Liz with whom the father lived in incestuous
relations, was also allowed to live illicitly with a man who worked for her
father. She was so simple that she talked openly about her relations with her
father and with this man. When a child was to be born the man married her.</p>

<p>"This is not all, but enough: and sufficient to show what feeble-mindedness
leads to when it takes the direction of sexual abuses."</p>

<b>Severe Anemia: Pernicious Anemia</b>.&mdash;This is the
most severe form of anemia, or the condition in which we
have the poorest blood. While this condition frequently
results in death the others rarely ever do. This condition
is not common in childhood.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;There is intense weakness and prostration.
The skin is very pale, the mucous membranes are
bluish white. The breath is markedly short and there
is often dropsy of the limbs and feet. Fever is often
present and quite high. The disease lasts a number of
months; the patient often feels better for a time, then
relapses into a more serious condition than before.</p>


<h4>TREATMENT OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF ANEMIA</h4>

<p><b>Simple Anemia</b>.&mdash;Find the cause and stop it. In infancy
special attention should be given to diet and hygiene,
giving the child plenty of fresh air, and a change of air
to the country or seashore if necessary. The general
treatment is more important than any benefit that may be
derived from drugs. The rules laid down in the articles
on "Malnutrition" must be closely followed in these children.</p>

<p><b>Chlorosis</b>.&mdash;In this form of anemia, or poor blood, it
is best to give iron. Change of air and change of scene
are of special importance in these cases and will frequently
cure. The general condition of course must not
be overlooked. The diet, exercise, bowels, habits, should
receive careful attention. Iron should be continued for a
number of months after all traces of the anemia have disappeared.</p>

<p><b>Pernicious Anemia</b>.&mdash;For this condition arsenic is the
one remedy needful. In all conditions of poor blood the
most careful attention should be given to the general
health. Colds must be guarded against. The patients
should never get their feet or their clothes wet. Muscular
exercise, because of the weak condition of the heart,
should be moderate, and only given on the advice of a
physician. It is frequently necessary to stop all forms of
exercise and in many instances we get the best results by
directing complete rest in bed for a considerable part of
the day or for all day if the case demands it.

<h4>RHEUMATISM</h4>

<p>This is a rather common disease of childhood. It occurs
most frequently between the ages of nine and
thirteen years. Children can have it, however, at any age.</p>

<p>The symptoms of rheumatism in children are much
the same, though somewhat milder, as when the disease
is present in an adult. Children are not quite as sick, nor
is the fever as high, nor is the pain as great as in a grown
person. In children the disease does not last as long, as a
rule. Sometimes it will jump from one joint to another,
and may, as a consequence, become chronic. When a
child has once had rheumatism, it has the same disposition
to recur that it has in adults. The principal danger
of rheumatism in children is its tendency to attack the
heart. Even mild attacks of the disease can do serious
damage to the heart.</p>

<p>Children who have the rheumatic tendency invariably
suffer from inflammatory conditions of the upper
respiratory tract. They are prone to have recurring
colds, tonsilitis, and sore throats. Treatment of
conditions without regard to the underlying
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a>]</span>
rheumatism is never satisfactory. These children complain of
indefinite pains, now in one place, now in another. These
pains are commonly known as "growing-pains" and, inasmuch
as they are rheumatic and not "growing pains,"
they should be regarded seriously because of the heart
damage they might do if ignored, and especially so since
the mildest attacks of rheumatism, without any joint
symptoms even, frequently leave the heart in very bad
shape. As a general rule it will be found that when a
child has had a number of attacks of bronchitis or asthma
it is rheumatic and should receive treatment for the
rheumatic tendency.</p>

<p>Children with the tendency to rheumatism invariably
eat too much red meats and sugar,&mdash;the latter in the form
of candy or as an excess in the food.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of an Acute Attack</b>.&mdash;The child should be
put in bed and kept warm. The bowels should be freely
opened with citrate of magnesia. The diet should be very
light: milk and lime water or milk and vichy water, with
a piece of dry toast or zwieback, is all the child needs
until the fever is relieved. When a single joint is affected
local measures may be taken for its relief. Wraping
the joints up with flannel cloths which have been
wrung out of true oil of wintergreen, and outside of this
oiled silk snugly bandaged on, is an excellent external application.
The flannel cloths should be kept moist by
adding a little of the wintergreen from time to time as
it dries in. This can be done without removing the
bandage. This application is kept in place for twenty-four
hours and renewed if necessary. Such an external
application will aid in the actual cure of the disease and
will quickly relieve the patient of the pain. The oil of
wintergreen used in this way should be the "true" oil, and
should be so specified when bought in the drug store.</p>

<p>Because of the great tendency to attack the heart a
physician should take charge of every case of acute
rheumatism in a child.</p>

<p><b>To Treat the Tendency to Rheumatism</b>.&mdash;Exclude
red meats and sugar in all forms as much as is possible.
Give green vegetables freely, potatoes boiled with the
skins on, fish, eggs, and poultry. Cereals with milk,
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a>]</span>
especially well cooked Scotch oatmeal, are exceedingly
good for these children. By keeping up this diet after
the acute attack has passed for a considerable time, it
is possible to cure the various other complaints with which
the child is afflicted,&mdash;tonsilitis, sore-throats, winter
coughs, head-colds, bronchitis, asthma, etc.</p>

<p>These children should wear woolen underwear all the
year round. They should be encouraged to drink water
or vichy freely between meals.</p>

<p>In the treatment of an acute attack as given above
it will be observed that no drugs are mentioned. This
is intentional because it would be unjust to encourage the
home treatment of a disease that is so treacherous, even
in its mildest forms. Because of its tendency to recur
and with each recurrence the danger of the heart being
affected, it is advisable to put these children on cod liver
oil or iron or some other good tonic. Every precaution
should be taken to prevent these children from getting
their feet wet or being out in the rain.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY:&mdash;</b></p>

<blockquote><p>Rheumatism is a dangerous disease in children.</p>

<p>In its mildest forms it can affect the heart badly.</p>

<p>It has a distinct tendency to recur.</p>

<p>Rheumatic children are afflicted with a number of diseased
conditions which do not respond to treatment
unless the rheumatism is treated.</p>

<p>Acute rheumatism should never be treated except by a
physician because of its treacherous character.</p></blockquote>


<h4>MALARIA. INTERMITTENT FEVER</h4>

<p>Malaria occurs quite often in infants and children. As
a rule the child gives evidence of gastro-intestinal disturbance
for a short period before the malarial symptoms appear.
The chilly stage is often absent. Sometimes the
hands and feet are cold and may be slightly blue and the
child may appear to be in collapse. This stage may last
for an hour or longer. The chilly stage may, however, be
replaced by nervous symptoms,&mdash;restlessness, dizziness,
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a>]</span>
irritability, nausea, etc.,&mdash;or a convulsion may take place.
In the second stage the temperature may rise quite high,
the pulse may be quite rapid; the child is flushed, restless,
and cries. This period may last from half an hour to two
hours. The sweating stage is not as a rule well marked in
a child. It may be very slight or not at all.</p>

<p>Between the attacks some children may be entirely
well; others remain restless, have little appetite and poor
digestion. Malaria in children does not always follow a
typical course. We often see children suffering from
spasms, fainting spells, neuralgias, diarrhea, vomiting,
and skin eruptions, all due to the malarial condition. This
often leads to a mistake in diagnosis. Intermittent fever
is often mistaken for pneumonia. Malaria is not a favorable
disease for an infant to have. It rapidly weakens the
child and great debility and anemia follows.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The treatment for malaria in children is
by the administration of quinine as in adults. It must,
however, be given with care and intelligence; for this
reason no mother should begin dosing her child with it
without consulting a physician.</p>


<h4>REGARDING MOSQUITOES</h4>

<p>The following is an extract from a circular in relation
to the causation and prevention of malaria and the life
history and extermination of mosquitoes issued by the
Department of Health, City of New York:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><b>Extermination and Prevention of Mosquitoes
</b>.&mdash;Mosquitoes require for their development standing water. They
cannot arise in any other way. A single crop soon dies and disappears
unless the females find water on which their eggs may be laid. In order
to prevent mosquitoes, therefore, the requirement is simple.</p>

<p><b>No Standing Water</b>.&mdash;Pools of rain water, duck ponds, ice
ponds, and temporary accumulations due to building; marshes,
both of salt and fresh water, and road-side drains; pots, kettles,
tubs, springs, barrels of water, and other back-yard collections,
should be drained, filled with earth, or emptied.</p>

<p>Running streams should have their margins carefully
cleaned and covered with gravel to prevent weeds and grass
at the water's edge.</p>

<p>Lily ponds and fountain pools should, if possible, be abolished;
if not, the margins should be cemented or carefully
graveled, a good stock of minnows put in the water, and
green slime (Alg&aelig;) regularly cleaned out, as it collects.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a>]</span></p>

<p>Where tanks, cisterns, wells or springs are necessary to
supply water, the openings to them should be closely covered
with wire gauze (galvanized to prevent rusting), not the
smallest aperture being left.</p>

<p>When neither drainage nor covering is practicable, the surface
of the standing water should be covered with a film of light
fuel oil (or kerosene) which chokes and kills the larv&aelig;.
The oil may be poured on from a can or from a sprinkler.
It will spread itself. One ounce of oil is sufficient to cover
15 square feet of water. The oil should be renewed once a
week during warm weather.</p>

<p>Particular attention should be paid to cess-pools. These
pools when uncovered breed mosquitoes in vast numbers; if
not tightly closed by a cemented top or by wire-gauze, they
should be treated once a week with an excess of kerosene or
light fuel oil.</p>

<p>Certain simple precautions suffice to protect persons living
in malarial districts from infection:</p>

<p>First: Proper screening of the house to prevent the entrance
of the mosquitoes (after careful search for and destruction
of all those already present in the house), and
screening of the bed at night. The chief danger of infection
is at night (the Anopheles bite mostly at this time).</p>

<p>Second: The screening of persons in malarial districts who
are suffering from malarial fever, so that mosquitoes may not
bite them and thus become infected.</p>

<p>Third: The administration of quinine in full doses to malarial
patients to destroy the malarial organisms in the
blood.</p>

<p>Fourth: The destruction of mosquitoes by one or more of
the methods already described.</p>

<p>These measures, if properly carried out, will greatly restrict
the prevalence of the disease, and will prevent the occurrence
of new malarial infections.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that when a person is once infected,
the organisms may remain in the body for many years, producing
from time to time relapses of the fever.</p>

<p>A case of malarial infection in a house (whether the person
is actively ill or the infection is latent) in a locality
where Anophele mosquitoes are present, is a constant source
of danger, not only to the inmates of the house, but to the
immediate neighborhood, if proper precautions are not taken.
It should be noted in this connection that the mosquitoes
may remain in a house through an entire winter and probably
infect the inmates in the spring upon the return of the
warm weather.</p>

<p>Malarial fever is prevalent in certain boroughs of New
York City, and in view of the presence of standing water
resulting from the extensive excavations taking place in various
parts of these boroughs, is likely to extend, if means are
not taken for its prevention.</p></div>

<h4>REGULATIONS OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH, NEW
YORK CITY, IN AID OF MOSQUITO EXTERMINATION
AND THE PREVENTION
OF MALARIAL FEVER</h4>

<p class="center">(In Force from March 15 to October 15.)</p>

<blockquote><p>1. No rain-water barrel, cistern, or other
receptacle for rain-water, shall be maintained without being tightly
screened by netting, or so absolutely covered that no mosquito can
enter.</p>

<p>2. No cans, pails, or anything capable of
holding water, shall be thrown out or allowed to remain
unburied on or about any premises.</p>

<p>3. Every uncovered cesspool or tank shall be kept in
such condition that oil may be freely distributed
so as to flow over the surface of the water.
Covered cess-pools must have perfectly tight
covers, and all openings must be screened.</p>

<p>4. No waste or other water shall be thrown out or allowed to stand
on or near premises.</p>

<p>Information is requested as to the presence of standing
water anywhere, so that the premises may be inspected
and the legal remedies against the same be applied.</p>

<p>The prompt co&ouml;peration of all persons in the enforcement
of the above regulations is earnestly desired, and
they are assured that in this way the breeding of mosquitoes
on their premises may be prevented.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes are, so far as known, the only means of
conveying malaria.</p></blockquote>


<h4>"RASHES" OF CHILDHOOD</h4>

<p>The following table gives all the characteristics of the
rashes that accompany the eruptive fevers. The term
"incubation" means the period of time which elapses between
the time when the child was exposed to, or caught
the disease, and the time when the child is taken sick. It is
sometimes interesting to know where a child could have
caught a disease; so if we know the incubation period we
can tell exactly where the child was on the day, or days,
when it was infected.

</table></div>


<p><b>Other Rashes</b>.&mdash;There are so-called "stomach" rashes
which are a source of much worry to mothers. These
rashes may appear at any time and they may be limited to
certain parts or may cover most of the body. They may
be bright red, or they may be simply a general discoloration.
They may appear as blotches or they may spread
all over, like the rash of scarlet fever when at its height.</p>

<p>These rashes are of no importance, except that they indicate
some derangement of the gastro-intestinal tract.
As a rule they indicate indiscriminate feeding or overfeeding.
Children who have had too much candy or pastries,
or who have been fed things which are unsuited to
their age, frequently develop rashes. Such children
should have a thorough cleaning out; a dose of castor
oil is probably the best cathartic to give them.</p>

<p>The mother may readily learn to know the difference
between a rash that is unimportant and one that indicates
one of the eruptive diseases, if she gives the matter
a little careful thought. In the first place a child
who is about to become the victim of one of the eruptive
diseases will be sick, and will have a fever for two or
three days before any rash appears; while on the other
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a>]</span>
hand a child may go to bed in good health and may next
morning be covered with a general rash, or with large
blotches, without any fever and without any evidence of
ill-health, except the skin condition. In the second place,
if the mother gives the child a cathartic and restricts the
diet for a day the rash will disappear, and good spirits
and good health will be maintained; on the other hand,
the giving of a cathartic to a child who is the victim of
an eruptive disease will not tend to diminish the rash, but
may accentuate it.</p>

<p><b>Pimples: Blackheads (Acne)</b>.&mdash;This eruption is
situated chiefly on the face. It may appear, however, on
the back, shoulders, and on the chest. It is mostly seen in
young men and women about the age of puberty. It appears
as conical elevations of the size of a pea; they are
red and tender on pressure, and have a tendency to form
matter, or pus, in their center. In from four to ten days
the matter is discharged but the red spots continue for
some time longer.</p>

<p><b>"Blackheads"</b> appear as slightly elevated spots of a
black color out of which a small worm-like substance may
be pressed. Pimples and blackheads are due to inflammation
of the glands of the skin. The mouths of these
glands become filled with dust which acts as a plug causing
the retention of the oily matter of the gland which
becomes inflamed and hence the pimples and blackheads.
Certain constitutional conditions favor the development of
these skin blemishes. Constipation, indigestion, bad blood
from unsanitary and bad hygienic surroundings, self-abuse
and bad sexual habits favor the appearance of these
skin affections.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The patient must avoid tea, coffee,
tobacco, alcohol, veal, pork, fats, candy, pastries, cheese,
and all edibles that are known to disagree with the digestion
of the patient. Constipation must be avoided; if
necessary, laxatives may be taken to keep the bowel open.
The blackheads must be squeezed out with an instrument
made for the purpose, not with the finger nails. Pimples
must be opened with a sterile needle. The parts should
be washed three times a day with hot water and green
soap, and the following mixture applied at night:&mdash;

<h4>CONVULSIONS. FITS. SPASMS</h4>

<p>Convulsions are quite common in children, especially
those under three years of age.</p>

<p>A convulsion in an infant immediately, or within three
months, after its birth is the result of injury, either at
birth or later (a fall for example) which seriously affects
the brain itself. After the third month the cause of
fits or convulsions is, in a very large percentage of the
cases, to be found in errors of diet resulting in disturbances
in the stomach or bowels&mdash;eating of articles of food
difficult to digest, as green or overripe fruit, salads, fresh
bread, pickles, cheese, etc. Children of a nervous temperament
are more liable to convulsions than are others.
Females are more frequently victims of fits than are male
children.</p>

<p>In infants convulsions often result from changes in the
mother's milk. Mental excitement, deep emotion, anger,
frights, severe affliction and distress will so affect a woman's
milk that it will cause convulsions in her child if she
nurses it while under the influence of any of these conditions.</p>

<p>Convulsions may result from any condition that disturbs
the nutrition of the child, as, for example,&mdash;exhaustion,
anemia, intestinal indigestion, blood poison, and
general weakness resulting from some severe sickness,
especially those of the digestive organs.</p>

<p>Various forms of brain disease cause spasms and fits;
the most common are meningitis, tumors, hemorrhage,
abscesses and injuries. Convulsions may accompany certain
conditions, as, the presence of worms, teething, severe
burns, foreign bodies in the ear, whooping cough,
pneumonia scarlet fever, malaria, sometimes measles, typhoid
fever, and diphtheria. Children who are badly
nourished and who live constantly in unsanitary surroundings
are more apt to have convulsions than those
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a>]</span>
who are well nourished and who live hygienically. One
attack renders the patient more liable to another, and
when the "habit" is established any trivial cause may incite
a convulsion; persistent and systematic efforts should
therefore be taken to prevent the attacks. The best preventives
are:</p>

<blockquote><p>1st. To regulate the diet and the bowels.</p>

<p>2nd. Remove adenoids and worms, if they exist.</p>

<p>3rd. Avoid the use of alcohol, coffee, tea, fresh bread, pastries, candies and all improper
foods.</p>

<p>4th. Guard the child against catching cold, infectious
diseases and all fevers. In other words, save the child
from the cause and the convulsion will not take place.</p></blockquote>

<p>By regulating the bowels we mean that everything the
child eats must be seen by the mother, must be with the
mother's permission, and must be suited to the child's age.
If there is any question about the latter it will be advisable
to have a physician write out a list of articles suitable to
the child. It is generally necessary to eliminate meats,
pastries, candies, sugar to a large extent, gravies, salads,
sauces, and all the extras of the table, as pickles, mustard,
relish, etc., as well as coffee, tea, cocoa, and alcohol.</p>

<p>The child should live in the open air as much as possible;
a daily warm bath, followed by a quick, cold sponge,
is a necessity.</p>

<p>Children subject to fits are possessed of a highly nervous
temperament. They are difficult to manage unless
managed with firmness and tact. It is not necessary to
be harsh, but it is imperative to be firm and decided. They
must be made to realize that they are not "the master,"
that their will is not supreme, and the mother must exact
this condition; otherwise these children will become dictators
and selfish despots&mdash;ruining the discipline of the
home, spoiling their own chance of physical health, and
rendering unhappy everyone around them. The parents,
therefore, have a definite duty to perform and it is not
an easy one. The food should be so regulated that each
day a natural movement of the bowels will take place.
(See article on constipation, page 303.) If a day should
pass without a movement the child should be given a hot
rectal enema as described on page<a href="#Page_586">586</a>.

<p>The adenoids can be easily demonstrated to either exist
or be absent. (See page <a href="#Page_519">519</a>.) If worms are known to
be present in the child they should be at once removed. If
they are simply suspected, the child should receive treatment
for them, just the same. (See page <a href="#Page_549">549</a>.)</p>

<p>By going a long time without a convulsion the nervous
system will recuperate itself, and become so strong and
healthy that what once would cause a fit will make no impression
in its new strengthened state; therefore, if you
"save the child from the cause," the convulsions will cure
themselves, as it were.</p>

<p>There are some cases of convulsions for which no satisfactory
explanation can be found.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;When a child has a convulsion, remove
its clothing and put it into a mustard bath. The temperature
of the bath should be 105&deg; F. Every part of the
child should be under the water except the head, which
is supported in the palm of the hand. While it is in the
bath its body, and especially its arms and legs, should
be briskly rubbed by the hands of an assistant in order to
keep the circulation active. A rectal injection of soap
suds or plain salt and water (see page <a href="#Page_579">579</a>) should be
given while the child is in the bath, because, as explained
above, a large percentage of these cases are caused by gastro-intestinal
derangements. The rectal injection will
likely remove the cause. An ordinary convulsion lasts
from five to ten minutes. When the child is removed
from the bath it should be placed in a warm, comfortable
bed and kept absolutely quiet. A hot-water bottle may
be put near its feet and an ice-bag or cold cloths should
be kept on its head. It should be given a full dose of
castor oil and allowed to go to sleep. Its diet should
consist of light broths for two or three days and during
this time it should not be disturbed or annoyed by too
much attention. This is as far as it is wise or safe for
any mother to go in the treatment of convulsions. A
physician should be called in every instance, because a
convulsion should never be regarded lightly. Many children
have become idiots, others have been afflicted with
paralysis, because of inattention at the proper time.

<p><b>SUMMARY:&mdash;</b></p>

<blockquote><p>1st. Convulsions must always be regarded as
serious.</p>

<p>2nd. Convulsions demand prompt treatment.</p>

<p>3rd. Every mother should know that an English mustard
bath&mdash;hot&mdash;is the first resort in convulsions.</p>

<p>4th. While this is being done she can read the home treatment in
this book and carry it out before the doctor comes.</p>

<p>5th. If the fit is not caused by some stomach or intestinal
trouble, have the physician find out the cause and tell you what to
do, and do it faithfully, because if you neglect the proper treatment
the child may become idiotic or paralyzed.</p></blockquote>


<h4>BED WETTING. ENURESIS&mdash;INCONTINENCE</h4>

<p>Enuresis, or incontinence of urine, is customary in infancy.
Just when urination becomes a voluntary act depends
upon the development and training of the individual
child. As a rule children can be taught to control
this function during the day, or while awake, about the
tenth month. It is not under control during sleep until
a much later period, usually by the end of the second
year, but lack of control should not be regarded as abnormal
until the child has entered the fourth year. If the
child fails to control the act of urination during the day
at the end of the second year, and is addicted to habitual
bed-wetting, some measures should be adopted to cure the
condition.</p>

<p>Boys under twelve years of age seem to be affected
more frequently than girls. It is wrong to assume that
it is caused by negligence or laziness, as some parents do.
It has generally a special cause, and the cause usually
can be found if it is carefully sought for. It may be the
result of bad habits: exposure to cold in the night; lying
on the back; drinking too much liquid in the afternoon
or at bedtime. It may be due to too much acid in the
urine, and if so it will be found necessary to reduce
meats and eggs the child is eating. Worms, stone in the
bladder, some anatomical abnormality or deficiency, may
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a>]</span>
be responsible for it. The diet may be at fault; adenoids
are supposed by some physicians to be the cause. No
matter what the actual cause may be, it must be found
and remedied before we can hope for a permanent cure.
A very large majority of these cases are due to nervousness.
These children are of a nervous temperament.
They are not necessarily sickly children; they are simply
of a nervous type. They are well-nourished, active, and
lively. Incontinence of urine during the day and long-continued
bed-wetting does not at all affect the health of
the child. If they are in poor health, it is essential to
treat their general condition before trying to cure the
incontinence.</p>

<p>It is absolutely wrong to punish or to crush the spirit
of these children. Constant nagging and taunting, even
if done in the hope of shaming the child into a cure, will
simply make a coward of him and will not aid in improving
matters, but will be distinctly detrimental.</p>

<p>Scrupulous cleanliness must be constantly practiced or
these children, if neglected, may develop ulcers and sores
of a very obstinate character. The odor is also bad for
the health of the child.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Find and remove the cause if possible.
If due to general poor health, give tonics, obtain a change
of air, and build the child up. Reduce the total quantity
of liquids, if in excess, and be very careful not to give any
liquids near bedtime. Don't cover these children too
much; they should never be "too warm"; they should
sleep in a well-aired room, and they should receive a
quick, cool sponge bath every morning. They should be
taught to sleep on their sides, never on their backs. Their
diet should be light but nourishing. When bed-wetting
is established it will continue, if untreated, until the child
is eight or ten years of age, and it frequently lasts much
longer. When treatment is undertaken it should be distinctly
understood by the mother that it will take many
months to cure; and during these months she must give
her constant attention to the child. If she does not undertake
to do this, or if she fails to do it, the treatment
should not be begun at all, as it will not succeed. Various
plans should be tried to keep the child from sleeping on
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a>]</span>
its back. The reason of this is because it has been found
that the child wets the bed only when sleeping on its back
and never when sleeping on its side. The simplest
method, of tying a towel or cloth around the child with
a knot over the spinal column, so that it will hurt and
waken it, if it turns on its back, is a very good one and
should be carefully tried for some time. The nervous
system of these children should never be overtaxed at
home or at school. Early hours and plenty of sleep are
desirable. Certain articles of diet of a stimulating character
should be entirely avoided,&mdash;for example, coffee,
tea, beer, candies, sugars, and pickles. The best diet for
these children is one composed exclusively of milk, vegetables,
fruits, meats, and cereals. Meats, however, should
be given only once every two days. It is a good plan to
teach the child to hold his water during the day, as long
as he can, to accustom the bladder to being full. Adenoid
growths, which contribute to the nervousness of a
naturally nervous child, should be removed. It is a good
plan to take the child up when the parents go in bed
and let him urinate. This often cures the condition in
itself.</p>

<p>Sometimes moral measures, such as the promise of a
reward, will strengthen the will so that the child may
overcome the tendency. Find out what the child most
desires in the way of a toy, and promise it if he goes so
long without wetting the bed. Aid and encourage him
to make efforts to win the reward.</p>

<p>If drugs have to be resorted to, it is necessary to call
the family physician, as the only drugs that are of any
use are very powerful and have to be given with great
care and caution. It is the experience of most physicians
and specialists, however, that in a large majority of cases
the treatment, along the lines as given above, will be effective,
without drugs, if faithfully persisted in by the
mother.</p>

<p>These children should be examined by a physician.
The cause of the bed-wetting is frequently discovered to
be produced by anatomical abnormalities which render
circumcision imperative. In these cases no method of
treatment will succeed until circumcision is performed.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a>]</span></p>


<h4>SLEEPLESSNESS. DISTURBED SLEEP</h4>

<p><b>Causes</b>.&mdash;In babies, disturbed sleep is most frequently
due to hunger or to indigestion. The latter is the result
of overfeeding or improper feeding. Rocking the child
to sleep, or feeding it during the night will cause sleeplessness.
Teething, colic, or any pain will result in disturbed
sleep. Nervous children are frequently poor
sleepers.</p>

<p>In older children, some digestive disturbance is, as a
rule, the cause. Chronic intestinal indigestion, worms,
adenoid growths, enlarged tonsils, lack of fresh air in the
bedroom, cold feet, may, however, be the cause. Overstudy
in school, poor blood, poor nourishment are always
accompanied by inability to sleep soundly. Too strenuous
play, exciting stories read before bedtime, may cause
sleeplessness.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The removal of the cause is absolutely
necessary. In order to discover the cause it is sometimes
essential to study the child's whole routine in order to
be able to tell exactly just what is causing the apparent
insomnia. It may be necessary to change the method
of feeding, to regulate the studies and the exercises, and
to suggest changes regarding the sanitary and hygienic
environment of the child's life. Mothers must be warned
against using drugs in the form of soothing syrups or
teething mixtures. They are dangerous and absolutely
forbidden under the above conditions.</p>

<p>The nervous disposition of the child must be taken into
consideration and treated if necessary. If bad habits exist
they must be stopped. Poor blood and poor nutrition
must receive the treatment suggested under these headings.</p>


<h4>NIGHTMARE. NIGHT TERRORS</h4>

<p>In a nightmare a child wakes suddenly in a state of
fright and will inform you that it has had a bad dream.
His mind seems clear and he recognizes those about him.
He is not easily calmed and may cry for some time; finally
he goes to sleep again. The next day he will remember
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a>]</span>
the dream and most of the incidents of the night
before. Such cases are quite frequent. They are to be
treated in the same way as cases of disturbed sleep, as
they really have the same cause. They are mostly due
to digestive disturbances and errors of diet.</p>

<p><b>Night-Terrors</b>.&mdash;Cases under this heading form a
distinct group by themselves. They are not frequent,
but the condition is much more serious. The cause seems
to be wholly nervous and may indicate an important nervous
derangement. It seems to have some indefinite relation
to such conditions as migraine, hysteria, epilepsy,
and even insanity. The child wakes suddenly during the
night and sits up, evidently in terror; he does not apparently
regain his full consciousness. He talks of being
scared, calls for his mother, trembles and shakes, cannot
answer questions intelligently, and after a time goes to
sleep. Next day he remembers nothing of the attack and
does not seem to suffer in any way as a result of it.</p>

<p>I am disposed to believe that all of these attacks are
not due to a nervous condition. A number of them of
exactly this type have been cured by absolutely withdrawing
milk from the diet.</p>

<p>It is a good plan to restrict the possibility of excessive
play in these children. They are of the type whose
play is work, and too much of it is too exhausting. Some
person should sleep in the same room with these patients
or in an adjoining room with the door open.</p>

<p>If the condition occurs frequently the child should be
subjected to a thorough physical examination, because
it may be one evidence of a serious ailment.</p>

<p>Sometimes these little patients have to be taken out
of school and sent to the country, where they should
remain for many months. It is far better to regard the
condition as indicating an abnormality,&mdash;even though it
may not have any deeper significance than that the digestive
apparatus of the child is not quite right,&mdash;and
make every effort to cure it, than to permit the child to
go on under what really are unjust and unfavorable
conditions.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a>]</span></p>


<h4>HEADACHE</h4>

<p>Headaches are not common in little children. The
most frequent ones are caused by:</p>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">1. Chronic indigestion and constipation.</span>
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">2. Anemia and malnutrition.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">3. Nervous disorders.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">4. Diseases of the eye, nose, throat.</span>
<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">5. Rheumatism and gout.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">6. Disturbances of the genital tract.</span>
<br />

<p>Those arising from anemia and poor nutrition are
most frequently present in girls from ten to fifteen years
of age. They may result from overcrowding of school
work, which results in loss of appetite and poor sleep.</p>

<p>Nervous headaches may be hereditary or acquired
through unhygienic surroundings. Hysteria, epilepsy,
disease of the brain, neuralgia from carious teeth, may
result in nervous headaches.</p>

<p>Headaches from disturbances of the genital tract may
afflict girls about the time of puberty.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;To remove the cause is the only plan
that promises any result. Each one must be investigated
by itself and dealt with accordingly. For the headache
itself a hot foot bath, cold to the head, and small doses
of phenacetine (one grain every hour for four doses)
are perhaps the most certain of all methods of treatment.</p>


<h4>THUMB-SUCKING</h4>

<p>The habit of sucking the thumb may be corrected by
wearing a pair of white mittens, or gloves tied at the
wrist. Should children attempt to suck the thumb with
gloves on, as some do, it will be necessary to saturate the
thumb and fingers of the gloves with tincture of aloes, or
a solution of the bisulphate of quinine, one dram to two
ounces of water.</p>


<h4>BITING THE FINGER NAILS</h4>

<p>Biting the finger nails may be stopped by the use of
the same bitter remedies as are used in thumb-sucking.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span></p>


<h4>HOW TO WASH OUT THE BOWELS</h4>

<h4>COLON IRRIGATION. A HIGH ENEMA</h4>

<p>Procure a soft rubber catheter,&mdash;No. 18 American is
about right. It is not advisable to get too soft rubber
for the reason that it will buckle when the child strains
and it will be impossible to wash out the bowel. Fill half
full an ordinary two-quart douche bag with water that
is warm, but not too hot. Dissolve a heaping teaspoonful
of table salt in a glass of hot water and add this to the
water in the bag. Hang the bag about two feet above
the level of the child, so that the water will not flow in
with too strong a stream; otherwise the child will immediately
try to eject it. If the water flows in gently,
the child may not object to it to the extent of making
strenuous efforts to force the catheter out.</p>

<p>Use the small sized nozzle that comes with the douche
bag. Place the rubber catheter over this nozzle, lubricate
the catheter, place the child on its back over a
douche pan, insert the catheter about two inches, let the
water run and as it runs in push the catheter up gently
until it is all in the bowel except the end on the douche
tip. The object of letting the water run while pushing in
the catheter is because it floats up with the water as it
distends the bowel; there is no risk then of pushing the
end into the intestinal wall or hurting the child. While
the water is flowing into the bowel it is a good plan to
compress the buttocks together to aid in holding the
water, as the child is very apt to let it run out as soon
as it feels uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The temperature of the water for the ordinary rectal
injection should be 95&deg; F. When the child is exhausted
or very weak, or when the circulation is poor, the temperature
of the water may be as high as 110&deg; F. When,
on the other hand, the fever is very high, the water may
be much cooler; as low as 70&deg; F. has been given with
good results on the fever. If the irrigation is given with
the intention of reducing the fever, it is best to begin
with water around 90&deg; F., and reduce it to 70&deg; F.,
gradually.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Indications for Irrigation of the Colon</b>.&mdash;When it is
desired to cleanse the bowel of any collection of matter
a colon irrigation is indicated. This matter may be
mucus, fecal substance, undigested food, or the decomposing
waste products which may remain there as a result
of disease or other conditions.</p>

<p>When it is desired to medicate by putting fluids into
the bowel we adopt the colon infusion.</p>

<p>Every diseased condition of the bowel does not, however,
indicate irrigation. If a child is having frequent
loose movements every half-hour it is safe to assume that
the bowel is being cleaned out sufficiently without any
artificial aid. To irrigate in these cases would only irritate
and would not accomplish anything. The cases
which are benefited are those in which we have a fever
with four or five green stools in the twenty-four hours,
or where we have a high fever with no movement at
all. To irrigate in these cases we not only get rid of
the products of decomposition, but we prevent further
decomposition and we reduce the fever, thereby contributing
to the general welfare of the child.</p>

<p>When the child is convalescing and when there is
only mucus in the stools, with no fever&mdash;as in cases of
chronic ileo-colitis&mdash;the colon irrigations should be
stopped, as they tend to keep up the discharge of mucus
in these cases. If, however, there is a relapse with fever,
which would indicate a fresh infection with more discharging
mucus and possibly green stools, the irrigation
must be used until the fever subsides.</p>

<p>Colon irrigations should always be given in every case
of convulsions in infancy, first to clean out the bowel
to prevent putrefaction, and second to empty the bowel
on general principles because an overloaded bowel is
very frequently the cause of convulsions in children.</p>

<p>When irrigation of the bowel is given at all it must be
given thoroughly. Enough water must pass into the
bowel to wash it all out. For this reason it is essential
that the catheter should be all in and in the bowel&mdash;not
doubled on itself two or three inches in the bowel. If
it is a serious case and the mother nervous, someone else
should give the washing&mdash;preferably the physician himself.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a>]</span>
If the child objects strenuously, as often happens,
it must be done with greater care to be successful. Remember
that a colon irrigation is never given unless it is
absolutely necessary and as a consequence it is given to
accomplish a certain purpose; it must, therefore, be done
thoroughly. If it is not, your child may miss the chance
it has of getting over some immediate difficulty and if
the moment of the "chance" is wasted or lost, that
moment will not return. Be thorough, therefore.</p>

<p><b>Enema</b>.&mdash;Some physicians talk about a high enema and
a low enema. A high enema is really an irrigation as
described above. The following remarks apply to low
enemas only.</p>

<p>A so-called low enema is given to clean out the rectum
of constipated matter, or for the introduction of food or
medicine by rectum, when for various reasons it is necessary
to spare the stomach.</p>

<p>It may be given with the fountain syringe or with the
ordinary bulb (baby) syringe. A catheter may be put
on the tip of the syringe if it is thought best to inject
higher up than in the rectum.</p>

<p>When an enema is used in infants or older children for
the relief of constipation, the best medium to use is
glycerine. For an infant, one teaspoonful to an ounce of
water is sufficient; for older children, one tablespoonful
to two ounces of water, given with the bulb syringe, will
give prompt results. If the constipation is pronounced,
the fecal mass very hard, an enema of sweet oil, allowed
to remain in for ten minutes, will soften it and permit
a movement.</p>

<p>Soap suds are often used. They are good but not
as reliable as the glycerine or oil; if, however, neither
of these two are at hand the soap suds may be
given.</p>

<p>Enemas should be carefully given and the liquid slowly
injected. If the fountain syringe is used care must be exercised
in not having the bag too high. If it is too high
the liquid will flow in too strongly, either injuring the
bowel wall or causing the child to strain immediately and
pass out the injection before it has an opportunity of
accomplishing its work.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a>]</span></p>

<p>The temperature of the enema should be warm&mdash;not
hot, and not cold, simply body heat.</p>


<h4>METHODS OF REDUCING FEVER</h4>

<p>During the course of acute illness it is frequently
necessary to reduce the fever, if possible, without the
use of drugs. The following means are often adopted.
It is desirable that the mother should know just how to
carry out these methods:</p>

<p><b>Ice-Cap</b>.&mdash;An ice-cap is used to protect the brain when
a child or adult is running a very high fever. It is put
on when the fever is above 103&deg; F. It may be used in
other conditions&mdash;brain disease, or disease of the
meninges or cord&mdash;in which case the physician will be
in attendance and will direct what should be done.</p>

<p>Ice-bags are procured in the drug stores. The best one
is the flat French ice-bag. Fill it three-quarters full of
finely chopped ice, put the ice-bag in a towel, and place
on the patient's head. There should be only one thickness
of the towel between the ice-bag and the head.</p>

<p>It will be necessary to keep a record of the fever so
that the ice-bag may be withdrawn when it falls below
103&deg; F.</p>

<p>When the ice melts the bag must be at once refilled.
This is often overlooked by careless mothers.</p>

<p><b>Cold Sponging</b>.&mdash;Cold sponging is used to reduce fever
or to allay nervous irritability. Equal parts of alcohol
and water or vinegar and water are used. The temperature
of the water should be 80&deg; to 85&deg; F.</p>

<p>Infants to be sponged should be completely undressed
and laid upon a blanket. The sponging should be done
for about fifteen or twenty minutes, after which the child
is wrapped in a dry blanket without further clothing
except the diaper. To be effective it must be done frequently.</p>

<p><b>Cold Pack</b>.&mdash;The cold pack is used to reduce fever. It
is one of the simplest and one of the best means we have.
The child is undressed completely, and laid upon a
blanket. It is completely covered with a small blanket
(except its head) wrung out of water at 100&deg; F. Outside
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a>]</span>
of this the child is rubbed with a piece of ice, front
and back, for a sufficiently long time to render the surface
cool, but not cold. Children take kindly to this
means of reducing fever; there is no shock and they are
quieted by it.</p>

<p>Just how long one will rub with the ice depends upon
circumstances. From five to thirty minutes may be employed.
The head should be sponged with cold water
while this is being done and it is a good plan to have a
hot-water bottle at the child's feet.</p>

<p><b>The Cold Bath</b>.&mdash;To reduce fever the cold bath is used
in the following way: Water at a temperature of 100&deg; F.
is put into the bath and the child is first put into this
water, then the water is reduced by putting into it
shaved ice until it reaches 80&deg; F. The child's body is
well rubbed while it is in the bath and cold water is applied
to its head. The bath is continued for five minutes,
or sometimes with a robust child to ten minutes. On
removal the child should be put into a warm blanket after
being thoroughly dried.</p>

<p><b>Rectal Irrigations</b>.&mdash;These are sometimes given to
reduce fever. They are very useful and very successful
if they are given properly and without exciting the child
too much. It is best to give water of an ordinary temperature
at first and gradually reduce it to 70&deg; F. It
should be continued for ten minutes or longer. It may
be repeated every three hours. (See page <a href="#Page_586">586</a>.)</p>


<h4>VARIOUS BATHS</h4>

<p>Every mother should know how to give any bath that
may be directed by the physician.</p>

<p><b>The Mustard Bath</b>.&mdash;Take from three to four tablespoonfuls
of English mustard; mix thoroughly in about
one gallon of warm water. Add to this about five gallons
of plain water at a temperature of 100&deg; F. If it
is necessary to raise the temperature of the water higher
it may be done by adding water until the temperature
reaches 105&deg; or 110&deg; F.</p>

<p>The mustard bath is exceedingly effective in cases of
shock, great sudden depression, collapse, heart failure,
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a>]</span>
or in sudden congestion of the lungs or brain. The special
use of the mustard bath is in the treatment of convulsions;
it is also useful for nervous children who sleep
badly. Two or three minutes in the mustard bath, followed
by a quick rubbing, will induce refreshing sleep
in these children. It is not necessary to have more than
one tablespoonful of mustard in these cases.</p>

<p><b>The Hot Bath</b>.&mdash;A bath is prepared of water at a
temperature of 100&deg; F. After the child is in the bath
the temperature of the water is raised to 105&deg;, or to
110&deg; F. It is not safe to go above this point.</p>

<p>The body of the child should be well rubbed while it
is in the bath. In most cases it is advisable to apply cold
water to the head while the child is in the bath. A bath
thermometer should be kept in the water to see that it
does not rise above the temperature desired.</p>

<p>The hot bath, like the mustard bath, is used to promote
reaction in cases of shock, collapse, etc., and in
convulsions.</p>

<p><b>The Hot Pack</b>.&mdash;Remove all clothing from the baby
and envelop the body in a sheet wrung out of water at a
temperature of 100&deg; F., to 105&deg; F., after which the
body should be rolled in a thick blanket. Those hot applications
may be changed every twenty minutes until
free perspiration is produced. This condition may be
kept up as long as is necessary.</p>

<p>The hot pack is used mainly in disease of the kidney.</p>

<p><b>The Hot-Air or Vapor Bath</b>.&mdash;The child is put in bed
wholly undressed with the bedclothing raised about twelve
inches, and held in that position by a wicker support.
The child's head is of course outside the bed clothing.
Beneath the bed clothing hot air or vapor from a croup
kettle is introduced. This will cause free perspiration in
twenty minutes. It may be continued from twenty to
thirty minutes at a time.</p>

<p>The vapor bath is used in diseases of the kidney, as
a rule.</p>

<p><b>The Bran Bath</b>.&mdash;In five gallons of water place a bag
in which is put one quart of ordinary wheat bran. The
bag is made of cheese cloth. Squeeze and manipulate
the bran bag until the water resembles a thin porridge.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a>]</span>
The temperature of the water is usually about 95&deg; F.,
though it may be given with any temperature of water.</p>

<p>The bran bath is of great value in eczema, or in
rashes about the buttocks, or in delicate skin conditions
when plain water would irritate.</p>

<p><b>The Tepid Bath</b>.&mdash;This bath may be given at a temperature
of 95&deg;, or 100&deg; F. It is of distinct advantage
in extremely nervous children. To induce sleep it is
often better than drugs.</p>

<p><b>The Cold Sponge or Shower Bath</b>.&mdash;This bath should
be given in the morning in a warm room. A tub should
be provided with enough water in it to cover the child's
feet. This water should be warm because when the feet
are in warm water it prevents the shock which frequently
comes when cold water is applied to any other part of
the body.</p>

<p>A large sponge is filled with water at a temperature of
from 40&deg; to 60&deg; F. This is squeezed a number of times
over the child's chest, shoulders, and back. While the
cold water is being applied the body should be well
rubbed with the free hand of the mother. The bath
should not last longer than half a minute. When finished
take the child out quickly and stand him on a bath
towel and give him a brisk rubbing with a bath towel
until the skin reacts. This is an exceedingly valuable
tonic for a delicate child. It should not be used on
younger children than eighteen months of age. In
younger children a cold plunge is preferable.</p>

<p>For the cold plunge water at a temperature of 55&deg;
F. is prepared. The child is lifted into this and given a
single dip up to the neck. He is then briskly rubbed off
as above.</p>

<p>There are a very few children who do not take kindly
to either the cold sponge or plunge. These children do
not react; they remain pale or blue and pinched for some
time after. It may be necessary to discontinue the procedure
or to use water of a higher temperature.</p>


<h4>POULTICES</h4>

<p>Poultices are useful in inflammation and for the relief
of pain. To be of any value they should be applied
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a>]</span>
frequently&mdash;every ten or twenty minutes&mdash;and they should
be applied hot.</p>

<p>Ground flaxseed is the best material for poultices. It
should be mixed with boiling water until the proper
thickness is reached. It may be kept simmering on a
fire. When one poultice is taken off it can be scraped into
the pot and heated over if there is no discharge. Each
poultice should be put into clean muslin, put on the part
and covered with oiled silk. This will help to retain the
heat and prevent the clothing or bed sheet from becoming
wet.</p>


<h4>HOT FOMENTATIONS</h4>

<p>A hot fomentation is simply a clean poultice. Several
thicknesses of flannel are taken, wrung out of very hot
water, covered with cotton batting, and then with oiled
silk.</p>

<p><b>How to Make and How to Apply a Mustard Paste</b>.&mdash;For
infants: Take one part English mustard to six
parts flour, mix with lukewarm water, and spread between
two layers of cheesecloth.</p>

<p>For older children and adults: Take one tablespoonful
English mustard to three or four tablespoonfuls of
flour, and mix as above.</p>

<p>Mustard pastes should be made big enough. You can
accomplish a great deal more by putting on a sufficiently
large mustard paste than by simply putting on one the
size of the palm of your hand.</p>

<p>It should be left on until the skin is distinctly red. The
length of time will depend, of course, upon the strength
of the mustard. Mustard pastes may be put on every
three hours, if necessary, and they may be used for a
week at this interval if the conditions demand it.</p>

<p>If they are used in pneumonia or other pulmonary
diseases, they should be used large enough to go around
the whole chest. If they are used in heart failure, they
should be big enough to cover the whole trunk.</p>

<p>When made with the white of an egg they will not
blister. Or if the part is rubbed with white vaseline
before applying, it will not blister and it will be just as
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a>]</span>
effective. When a mustard paste is removed the red
area should be rubbed with white vaseline and covered
with a clean piece of flannel.</p>

<p><b>How to Prepare and Use the Mustard Pack</b>.&mdash;The
child is stripped and laid upon a blanket, and the trunk is
surrounded by a large towel or sheet saturated with mustard
water. This is prepared as follows: Take one
tablespoonful of English mustard and dissolve it in one
quart of water, slightly warmed. Saturate a towel in
this mixture and apply to the body of the child while
it is dripping. The patient is then rolled in a blanket.
Keep the child in this pack for ten or fifteen minutes.
The mustard pack is not as good as the mustard bath,
but it is all that is necessary in a number of various conditions.
The physician will, of course, decide these matters.
It is simply the duty of the mother to know how
to carry out the physician's instructions.</p>

<p><b>The Turpentine Stupe</b>.&mdash;Take a piece of flannel, big
enough to cover the area which it is desired to affect,
wring it out of as hot water as it is possible. Upon this
sprinkle twenty drops of spirits of turpentine. Place
the stupe wherever it is desired and cover with a piece
of oiled silk or dry flannel. The turpentine stupe is
mostly used in pain of the abdominal cavity. In colic
from acute indigestion it is a very convenient means of
quieting the child by allaying the pain.</p>

<p>Care should be taken not to allow this form of application
to remain on too long. Take it off when the skin
is red. For continuous use it is not as good as the mustard
paste.</p>


<h4>OILED SILK. WHAT IT IS, AND WHY IT IS USED</h4>

<p>Oiled silk is sold in the drug stores by the yard. It is
one yard wide. It is used to cover any local application
to prevent evaporation into the air or to prevent the
clothing from absorbing the medicament. If a liniment
is applied on cloth to effect a certain result, it may take
some time to do its work. If the wet cloth is covered
with the clothing, the clothing will absorb the medicine
quicker than the body will and thereby defeat the object
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a>]</span>
in view, in addition to rendering the clothing wet and
nasty. If the application is covered with oiled silk it
cannot escape into the clothing, because the oiled silk is
impervious. The body will be compelled to absorb the
medicine and consequently results will be quicker and
more certain. Many liniments are expensive; to permit
them to be absorbed by the clothing is needless waste
It is therefore economical to apply the oiled silk.

<h4>RULES TO BE OBSERVED IN THE TREATMENT OF
CONTAGIOUS DISEASES</h4>


<p>Every mother should know the elementary principles
involved in the treatment of contagious diseases. They
are contagious because they may be conveyed from
one individual to another or because a person nursing a
victim of a contagious disease may carry that disease
to another person without having the disease herself.
For this reason, certain rules have been established by
the medical profession, which experience has taught
are necessary in order to preserve the health of the
community when such diseases are prevalent.</p>

<p>The very first rule to which the physician will direct
the mother's attention, when there is a contagious
disease, will be that the child must be "isolated."</p>

<p><b>What Isolation Means</b>.&mdash;Isolation means the complete
seclusion of the patient in a room by himself, so that
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a>]</span>
no one will see him or come in contact with him except
the physician and the nurse or mother who will
tend him during the entire course of the disease. Isolation
implies more than it would seem to mean. It
implies that every article used during the sickness will
be thoroughly disinfected before it leaves the room in
which the patient himself is isolated. Mothers must
always remember that every article used by the patient
may carry the germs of the disease to some other member
of the family or to some other individual. These
articles are the clothing of the child, the bedclothes,
napkins, handkerchiefs, towels, dishes, knives and spoons,
rags, the various discharges&mdash;sputum, urine, and bowel
passages&mdash;and, we may add to this list, flies, insects, and
domestic animals. Every precaution must, therefore, be
taken to safeguard any dissemination of the disease by
means of these articles.</p>

<p>Thorough isolation also implies that the nurse shall
frequently bathe and disinfect her person and her clothing,
and that the sick-room itself shall be carefully
dusted with a moist cloth and disinfected from time to
time.</p>

<p><b>The Contagious Sick-Room</b>.&mdash;The contagious sick-room
will be prepared in exactly the same way as the
ordinary sick-room which has been previously described.
In addition, however, it will be safeguarded in the following
manner. A wet sheet will be hung up outside the
door. This sheet will be kept constantly moistened with
a solution of chloride of lime. One-half pound to an
ordinary house-pail of water is the strength of the solution
to use. Every window must be effectively screened
to prevent the ingress and egress of flies and other insects.</p>

<p><b>Conduct and Dress of the Nurse</b>.&mdash;She will remain in
the sick-room all the time unless when she takes outdoor
exercise. Her dress will consist of a long gown
which will entirely cover her person from the neck to
the shoes and will be of plain, white, easily washed
material, without tucks or ruffles or adornment of any
kind. She should wear an ordinary pair of house slippers
made of light leather. Her cap will be large enough
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a>]</span>
to cover and include her hair and head. When she
leaves the room, she will remove her cap, gown, and slippers,
disinfect her hands in a disinfecting solution and
wash her face, neck, and hands in soap and water. She
should go directly out and in, without coming in contact
with any occupant of the home.</p>

<p><b>Feeding the Patient and Nurse</b>.&mdash;The meals for the
patient and nurse should be left on a table outside the
door of the sick-room, from which place the nurse will
then take them into the room. The utensils used for
these meals should not be used by other members of
the family during the entire sickness. After the patient
and nurse have eaten, the utensils should be placed in
a chloride of lime solution for disinfection. If any
of the food is left over it should be put into a jar in
which it may be disinfected and rendered harmless before
being disposed of.</p>

<p><b>How to Disinfect the Clothing and Linen</b>.&mdash;All bed
and body linen, towels, handkerchiefs, napkins, etc.,
should be immediately put into a large receptacle&mdash;a
wash boiler, or tub, will answer the purpose admirably&mdash;containing
a five per cent. solution of carbolic acid in
which an adequate quantity of soft soap has been dissolved.
They should remain in this mixture for two
hours, after which they may be wrung out and taken
to the laundry.</p>

<p><b>How to Disinfect the Urine and Feces</b>.&mdash;The urine
and the stools should be passed into vessels containing
a solution of four ounces of carbolic acid to the gallon
of water. This vessel should be covered and the mixture
allowed to stand for one hour, after which time it may
be thrown out.</p>

<p><b>How to Disinfect the Hands</b>.&mdash;Any of the following
solutions may be used for disinfection of the nurse's
hands: Creolin, one teaspoonful to the quart of water;
chloride of lime, one-half pound to a pail of water;
formalin, thirty-two drops to a quart of water. A basin
containing one of the above solutions should be constantly
kept standing for the frequent disinfection of the
nurse's hands. After disinfection, the hands should be
washed in plain water and soap.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Disinfection of Room Necessary</b>.&mdash;The room in which
a contagious patient is confined requires systematic attention
on the part of the nurse. Every other day all
flat or projecting surfaces should be disinfected. Mantels,
window-sills, door knobs, picture moldings, furniture,
chairs, and bed-railings, should be wiped with cloths
moistened in a disinfecting solution. A suitable solution
for this purpose is one containing one ounce of carbolic
acid to the quart of water.</p>

<p><b>How to Disinfect the Mouth and Nose</b>.&mdash;In the
course of all contagious diseases the mouth and throat
of the patient and nurse should be thoroughly disinfected
as a matter of routine. It should be done at
least twice daily unless more frequent disinfection is
called for because of the nature of the disease. In
measles and diphtheria, for example, the nasal and throat
conditions will undoubtedly call for more frequent and
more thorough disinfection than twice daily. This may
also apply to scarlet fever if the throat is involved as
is often the case.</p>

<p>Pocket handkerchiefs should never be used by a patient
suffering from a contagious disease. The nose
and mouth should be wiped with pieces of gauze or
cheesecloth, cut into small squares for this purpose. These
should be immediately burned after being used.</p>

<p>To disinfect the throat, a solution of formalin, six
drops to six ounces of water, is effective. To disinfect
the nose, a solution of Glyco-Thymoline is suitable. These
applications should be made by means of an atomizer, a
different atomizer being used for the patient and nurse.</p>

<p><b>Receptacle for the Sputum</b>.&mdash;A cuspidor, or basin,
should be constantly kept at the side of the bed in which
the patient may conveniently expectorate. This utensil
should contain the chloride of lime solution previously
mentioned.</p>

<p><b>Care of the Skin in Contagious Diseases</b>.&mdash;As in all
other sick conditions, the skin of the patient should be
bathed frequently with an alcoholic solution. In the
later stages of measles and scarlet fever it is essential
to anoint the skin while the patient is scaling. This
may be done with carbolated vaseline. Mothers should
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a>]</span>
understand why this is necessary. These diseases have
a distinct rash or eruption. This eruption practically
kills the skin cells and at a certain period these cells
are cast off by the new growth of skin underneath. This
process is called scaling. In measles the scales are small,
and are cast off in the form of bran like dust. In scarlet
fever, the cells adhere together and are cast off
in large scales. These scales are contagious. They are
very light and will float in the air if dry. The movement
of the patient, changing the bed clothing, etc.,
will waft a multitude of these contagious scales into the
air of the room and infect every article they may land
on. This would make the disinfection of the room difficult
and tedious. In order to obviate this tendency experience
has taught us that much of the difficulty and
nearly all of the risk of contagion may be overcome by
rubbing some oily or sticky substance on the skin. By
this method the dust and scales are rendered heavier
than the air, stick together and will not float. During
the scaling period there is a constant itch present which
irritates the little patient. By using carbolated vaseline
to anoint the skin we accomplish two purposes. The
carbolic acid in the vaseline relieves the itch, and the
vaseline itself greases the skin so that the scales remain
in the bed. Each day the nurse changes the
bed-sheet, gathers the scales in the sheet and puts all
in the disinfecting solution.</p>

<p><b>Convalescence After a Contagious Disease</b>.&mdash;Complete
isolation must be kept up until all danger from
contagion is passed. In diphtheria this period is not
reached until the examination of the throat contents
under the microscope is returned negative. In diseases
Which have a rash this period is not reached until all
scaling is completed. Even then, and for a number of
days or weeks, the patient may be taken out for exercise
daily, but must not be allowed to play with
other children until his strength justifies active exercise.
It takes a much longer period to rid the system of the
poison of a contagious disease than most mothers appreciate.
Many children have died from heart failure
after they were considered well simply because the active
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a>]</span>
exercise overtaxed the heart before the system was
wholly free from the poison of the disease.</p>

<p>Before the child is removed from the sick-room for
the first time he should have a disinfecting bath. This
bath should be in a solution of bichloride of mercury,
the strength of which should be one part to five thousand
parts of water. The towels used to dry the patient
after the bath should be fresh and should not
have been in the sick-room. He should then be dressed
in clothing which has never been in the sick-room.</p>


<h4>DISINFECTING THE SICK-CHAMBER</h4>

<p><b>How to Disinfect a Room</b>.&mdash;The most efficient way
to disinfect a room is by means of formaldehyde gas.
This, however, requires a special apparatus which can
only be used by one familiar with the process. In all
large cities the Department of Health usually undertakes
the disinfection of rooms after any contagious
disease. The next best method is by sulphur.</p>

<p>When sulphur is employed it should be used in the
form of powder or in small pieces. This is placed in a
shallow iron pan set on a couple of boards in a tub partly
filled with water. The sulphur is moistened with alcohol
before it is set on fire.</p>

<p>It is always necessary, of course, before disinfecting
by any process to make the room as nearly air tight as
is possible. To accomplish this the windows must be
tightly closed, the doors locked, and the cracks and keyhole
sealed with pieces of paper or adhesive paper. The
room should remain closed for six or eight hours, after
which it should be thoroughly aired for several days.</p>

<p><b>The After Treatment of a Disinfected Room</b>.&mdash;The
walls, ceiling, and all flat surfaces, such as mantels, window-sills,
etc., should be washed with a fresh chloride of
lime solution. The floor should be scrubbed with a four
per cent. soda solution. All carpets and curtains, if any,
should be removed, taken to a vacant lot and thoroughly
beaten and then exposed to direct sunlight for a number
of hours. The room should then be well aired
again for a couple of days before it is again occupied.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>How to Disinfect the Bed Clothing and Clothes</b>.&mdash;The
surest way is to boil them for half an hour; otherwise
they may be left in the room while it is being disinfected.
Spraying the clothes with a spray of formaldehyde
is an effective way of disinfecting them.</p>


<h4>MUMPS: EPIDEMIC PAROTITIS</h4>

<p>Mumps is a contagious disease. It is most common
between the fourth and sixth years. Infants are rarely
affected. The disease is not very contagious, direct
contact being necessary to communicate it. Every case
should be isolated for a period of three weeks from
the beginning of the disease.</p>

<p>The seat of the affection is the parotid gland which
is located in front of and on a level with the ear. One
or both glands may be affected at the same time or one
may follow the other in succumbing. The duration of
the disease from the time the swelling becomes noticeable
is about ten days. It is contagious for a week
after the swelling subsides. The period of incubation
is from one to three weeks.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;In the majority of cases the first symptom
is the swelling and the discomfort which it causes.
In more severe cases the child feels sick and is listless
for from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. There may
be a headache, vomiting, pains in the back and limbs,
and fever. There is pain in the swelling which is increased
by movement of the jaws and by pressure. The
degree of the swelling varies with the severity of the
attack. It may be very little or it may be so great
as to completely distort, and render unrecognizable, the
face. It must be remembered that, though mumps is
not regarded as an important or dangerous disease, it
may assume dangerous characteristics.</p>

<p>We sometimes see distressing complications with
mumps. In boys, orchitis, or inflammation of the testicles,
occasionally occur. In girls, ovaritis, or inflammation
of the ovaries may be present. These complications may
be avoided by keeping the patients in bed.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Keep the child in bed until the fever is
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a>]</span>
gone. Keep him in the house for one week after the
swelling has entirely subsided. He should be put on
a liquid diet while the fever lasts. The bowels should
move each day.</p>

<p>The mouth should be kept clean by an antiseptic mouth
wash. If there is much pain in the swollen gland, warm,
wet dressings give the best results. Sometimes it is
advisable to paint the gland with belladonna ointment.
If it is not very painful, the most comfortable way to
dress the gland is simply to place over it a large pad
of absorbent cotton held in place by a broad strip of
flannel cloth.</p>


<h4>CHICKEN POX. VARICELLA</h4>

<p>Chicken pox is an affection almost entirely special
to children, in whom it may be observed from their
first year, although it is especially frequent from the
ages of two to six. It appears often in the epidemical
form and spreads by contagion.</p>

<p>Some doctors are inclined to regard varicella as a
very attenuated form of smallpox, hence the name
"chicken pox," by which it is popularly known. This
opinion is based merely on the analogy between the two
types of skin eruptions and the coincidence sometimes
observed between two epidemics of smallpox and chicken
pox. But the theory falls on considering that, on the
one hand, chicken pox offers no safeguard against infection
by smallpox and does not prevent the effects
of vaccination, and, on the other hand the disease may
occur in children who have been vaccinated or who
have had smallpox. Chicken pox, too, differs essentially
from smallpox in the course of its development.</p>

<p>After a period of incubation, extending over a fortnight,
chicken pox becomes apparent by such symptoms
as slight shivering, extreme fatigue and a general but
not very intense condition of fever. In less than twenty-four
hours small pink spots will appear on the skin, and
these after a few hours are topped by a vesicle, and the
next day the whole rash shows a vesiculous appearance.</p>

<p>The vesicles are sometimes small and pointed, sometimes
more voluminous and globular in form. They
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a>]</span>
are filled with a limpid or a slightly yellowish liquid.
Their base is sometimes surrounded by an inflammatory
ring. By the third day the contents of the vesicle has
become thicker and tends to become purulent. On the
fourth day desiccation commences, and the vesicles
shrivel and shrink in and form small brownish scabs,
which fall about the eighth day. Frequently the child
will scratch them off with the finger nails before they
are entirely desiccated. The vesicles leave small reddish
spots, which generally disappear gradually, almost
always without a scar.</p>

<p>An eruption of chicken pox does not burst out all
over the body at once, but appears in successive rashes.
It is not confined to any special parts of the body. It
may begin and spread at the same time from the face,
the trunk of the body or the limbs. A dozen pimples
may be seen the first day, while three or even ten times
as many may be visible the next day, and so on for
several days in succession.</p>

<p>Sometimes the vesicles appear on mucous membrane at
different parts&mdash;the mouth, tongue, soft palate and tonsils&mdash;and
may also invade the conjunctiva and cornea, or
the larynx, where they will set up laryngitis.</p>

<p>Owing to the very contagious nature of chicken pox,
the first thing to be done is to provide for the complete
isolation during a period of twelve to fifteen days
of all patients attacked by the disease.</p>

<p>The treatment of the disease is solely a matter of
hygiene. The more severe the fever the stricter the
diet should be, and in the case of great fever, the diet
should be restricted to broth and milk. If there is no
fever the child need not be placed on any special diet.</p>

<p>If the intestines are sluggish, they may be stimulated
by administering a dose of castor oil. It is advisable to
make the patient rinse his mouth two or three times
a day with a mouth wash. It is also well to apply a
lotion around the eyes and face, consisting of two per
cent. boracic acid solution with the chill taken off.
Finally, in order to prevent the child scratching the
sores and the consequent danger of inoculation by the
finger nails, it is a good practice to rub a small amount
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a>]</span>
of carbolated vaseline over the itching parts. It is frequently
found necessary to have the little patient wear
white woolen gloves to prevent scratching and infecting
the sores. If a child scratches the sores on the face
it will leave an unsightly mark which will stay for the
rest of its life.</p>

<p>The child, of course, should not be allowed to rejoin
his playmates without having had a good bath, and having
had his clothes completely disinfected.</p>


<h4>INFLUENZA: LA GRIPPE</h4>

<p>The most important feature with reference to influenza
in children is its very active tendency to develop complications.
These complications generally affect the respiratory
tract. So we find in children suffering from
grippe an easy disposition to get bronchitis or broncho-pneumonia.
The younger the child the greater the
danger.</p>

<p>The disease itself, so long as it remains an uncomplicated
influenza, is not of much importance or severity.
The lesson to be learnt, therefore, is to treat the disease
with respect and take every precaution to avoid the
possibility of developing a complication.</p>

<p>La Grippe is a highly contagious disease. It prevails
epidemically, and after an active epidemic it may remain
in the vicinity for a number of years. It is more frequently
seen in the late winter months and early spring.
The poison of the disease clings to clothing and apartments
as well as to railroad and street cars. The germ
is found in the sputum and in the nasal secretions.</p>

<p>Sneezing is one of its symptoms and it is one of
the ways by which the disease is spread around. Children
should never be brought near an adult suffering
from influenza. One attack does not render the patient
immune to a subsequent attack as is the case with most
of the contagious diseases. The reverse is the rule with
La Grippe because one attack favors the development of
another attack. It is a common experience for many
people to have influenza every winter or spring.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;If a child "catches" grippe, it becomes
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a>]</span>
quite sick abruptly. There is usually chilliness, pains
in the muscles all over the body, more or less fever,
sometimes nausea and vomiting. If the attack is a more
severe one, the prostration is more marked, the temperature
higher and the signs of shock and poisoning of
the system are more in evidence. A child a few months
old can get influenza so severely as to cause collapse
and death in thirty-six hours. As a rule the type of
grippe most common in infancy is of a very mild character.
It lasts about a week. Children may be a little
slow in convalescing and it may be three or four weeks
before they regain their health.</p>

<p><b>Complications</b>.&mdash;As has been intimated, the most frequent
complication is bronchitis and the most fatal one
is broncho-pneumonia.</p>

<p>A congestion of the entire mucous membrane of the
respiratory tract, producing a nasal discharge, a sore
and inflamed throat, pains and a feeling of compression,
with a cough in the chest, may accompany the
disease.</p>

<p>Gastric symptoms, with vomiting, intestinal disturbance,
diarrhea, with or without mucus and blood, are
quite common in some epidemics.</p>

<p>Not infrequently we have numerous cases in which
the ear seems to be the vulnerable part. As a consequence
running ears have to receive most of our attention.
When the ears are affected, the glands of the neck
become inflamed. They swell up and add considerable
to the discomfort of the little patient.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Cases of influenza should be isolated.
Children should be put in a room by themselves and
the other children of the family should not be permitted
to see them. The rooms should be disinfected after
the case is over. As complications are the dangerous
element in grippe, we should try to prevent them. This
can be best done by promptly putting the child in bed,
making him comfortable, opening his bowels by castor
oil or calomel. He should be made to drink hot lemonade.
He should be kept on a light diet from which meat
and vegetables are excluded.</p>

<p>The above treatment will usually suffice in the ordinary
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a>]</span>
uncomplicated grippe. If complications arise they
must be treated according to the conditions.</p>

<p>It is well to remember that the degree of prostration
following a rather severe attack of grippe is out of all
proportion to the extent of the disease. These little patients
sometimes suffer considerably and do not regain
their strength promptly. Experience has taught us that
the best thing to do is to send them away. A change
of climate will do wonders for them, more quickly and
more thoroughly than all the medicine we can give them
at home. The seashore is particularly good for them.</p>


<h4>DIPHTHERIA</h4>

<p>Diphtheria is an acute, specific, infectious, communicable
disease. It affects the tonsils, throat, nose, or
larynx. It is most frequently seen in children between
the ages of two and five years, though it may appear at
any time during life. The two sexes are equally liable
to it. The same person may have the disease twice or
more times at different ages. Children suffering from
disease of the nose or throat are more likely to get it
than are others. Such diseases are cold in the head
with running nose, catarrh of the nose and throat, inflammation
of the mucous membranes of the nose or
throat.</p>

<p>Diphtheria may occur at any time of the year, though
it is more frequent during the cold months. The incubation,
or the length of time between exposure to the
disease and the development of the symptoms, is between
two and five days. In its mild form the disease may be
present without giving any constitutional symptoms. In
its severe form, however, it is one of the most dangerous
diseases of childhood. In large cities it is present all
the year round with more or less frequent outbreaks
in the form of local epidemics. In the country it is
only seen in its epidemic form. It does not arise without
a cause, that is, there is always a preceding case
from which an epidemic springs, though it is not always
easy to trace the connection. The child inhales the bacilli
which cause the disease with the air it breathes. The
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a>]</span>
bacilli may lodge on toys or other articles from which
the child gets them. Direct infection is usually the mode
of communication through which a child obtains the disease.
The saliva and mucus from the nose contain
the bacilli in large quantities and if a patient coughs
or sneezes they are expelled in this way and infect others.
Frequently a child suffering from a mild form of diphtheria
may attend school and infect others without it
being known that the child has the disease.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;The symptoms vary with the severity of
the attack. There are mild cases, as has been stated,
that give no constitutional symptoms. There may be a
small amount of local disturbance in the throat or nose
and there may be some membrane present, but, for some
reason, there does not seem to be any absorption of the
poison into the system and the child escapes the systemic
disturbance. Even as a local condition these cases vary.
There is always a fever at the beginning, but the child
never seems sick enough to go to bed. If the throat is
examined it will be found to be red and slightly inflamed,
there may be spots on the tonsils, or there may be
a gray film over them. There is no discharge from the
nose and the child does not complain of an excess of
mucus from the throat. The spots may last for a
week and then disappear. These cases are difficult to
diagnose without making a culture, and if the physician
insists upon keeping the child confined to bed while apparently
well the family as a rule object, though it is
absolutely necessary. These are the cases that do great
harm in school, and no mother should object if the physician
insists in taking preventative measures to stop
an epidemic if the bacilli have been found in the child's
throat. She should rather feel thankful that the child
escaped so easily.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of antitoxin we do not see the
severe cases now, so that a description of them would
not be of any use in a book of this character. Mothers
should, however, know that it is absolutely criminal to
take any chances with a "sore throat." Antitoxin is a
prompt and an absolute remedy if used soon after the
onset of the disease. It is more sure if used the first
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a>]</span>
or second day, still reliable the third day, but its efficacy
diminishes the longer we postpone its use from the date
of the onset of the disease. When, therefore, a child
complains of being sick and states that its throat hurts,
medical aid should be at once sought.</p>

<p>The disease may develop in one of two ways. It
may begin as a slight indisposition for a day or two,
and perhaps some soreness of the throat. The fever may
be slight. The child will continue to be sick despite
any treatment given and will get slowly worse until the
fourth or fifth day, when it will be impossible to mistake
the condition.</p>

<p>At other times the disease begins abruptly. The child
complains of being sick. It may vomit, or suffer from
headache, chilly feelings, and a fever. The glands in
the neck may swell and cause considerable disturbance.
There is, as a rule, an abundant discharge from the nose
and there is an excess of mucus in the throat. Membrane
is seen in the throat. It may cover the tonsils
and spread over the entire throat cavity, or it may extend
up into the nose and over the roof of the mouth.
All the parts are much swollen and breathing is interfered
with, sometimes seriously. If the attack is very
severe there is an active absorption of poison going on
from the throat which soon renders the little patient
intensely sick. There is marked weakness and prostration,
the circulation becomes poor, the pulse rapid and
the child falls into a stupor.</p>

<p>The physician will, of course, have taken complete
charge of the case before the patient has gone thus far.
The nursing of the case, which may fall to the mother
if no trained nurse is present, is most important. She
should preserve absolute cleanliness of herself and of
the sick room. She should never eat or sleep in the
same room with the patient, and should use a gargle,
which the physician should prescribe, frequently during
the day. She should dress simply, so that whatever is
worn can be changed often and washed easily. Every
article of furniture must be taken out of the sick room
that is not absolutely essential in the care of the case.
If toys are allowed they should be burned as soon as
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a>]</span>
the child is tired of them, never left around the house
after the case is over. The room should be a large one
and it should be thoroughly aired each day. The floor
should be washed each day with a solution of bichloride
of mercury, and all dusting should be done with a wet
cloth. The bed linen and any rags or handkerchiefs
used should be treated as in scarlet fever. All vessels
in which the patient expectorates should have an antiseptic
in them. The room must be disinfected after the
case is over.</p>

<p>The patient must be kept in bed during the entire attack.
He must not be allowed to even sit up in bed until
the physician gives him permission. This is a very important
essential in the treatment of this disease, and
the nurse must be held responsible for the conduct of
the patient in this respect. Because of the character of
the poison, there is a tendency to paralysis of the heart,
and frequently children have been allowed to sit up too
soon only to fall back dead in bed. The same thing has
occurred later in the disease when children have been
allowed to play too heartily before the poison had an
opportunity to completely eliminate itself. Nursing children
should be fed on breast milk pumped from the
mother, but they must not nurse it themselves. Older
children can take milk and should depend upon it mostly.
The physician will give any other special directions that
he may think necessary, the duty of the mother being
to see that they are faithfully carried out.</p>


<h4>WHOOPING-COUGH</h4>

<p>Whooping-cough is usually seen in young children.
It may, however, affect a person at any age. It is contagious.
During infancy it is one of the most fatal diseases.
During adult life it is a dangerous condition,
while in childhood it is simply regarded as a mildly contagious
disease.</p>

<p>It is most contagious during the catarrhal stage,&mdash;the
first ten days. Children suffering from whooping-cough
should not be allowed to mix or play with other
children for two months. After an exposure to the
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a>]</span>
disease it takes about fourteen days for a case to develop.
The danger of whooping-cough is the tendency to develop
pneumonia or bronchitis.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;During the first ten days the child acts
as if suffering from an ordinary catarrhal cold with
cough. This is called the catarrhal stage. There is no
way of telling that whooping-cough is present until the
child whoops. Most children do not whoop until the
expiration of the catarrhal stage, though a very few
do from the beginning of the disease. If a child is
treated for an ordinary cold with cough and does not
respond to treatment, and whooping-cough is epidemic,
it is fair to assume that whooping-cough has been contracted.
When the cough shows a distinct tendency to
be worse at night it is further proof of this assumption.</p>

<p>When they begin to cough in paroxysms, and whoop,
the second, or spasmodic stage begins. These fits of
paroxysmal coughing are much more severe than spells
of ordinary coughing. These may only be three or four
attacks daily, or the child may have from forty to fifty
such attacks. When children feel these attacks coming
on they seek support, holding on to chairs or they stand
by the mother's knee. The coughing is explosive, rapid,
and forceful, the child fails to catch its breath and is
compelled to take a deep inspiration, which is the whoop;
it then goes on coughing more. The face may become
purple, the eyes protrude, and the veins of the face swell
up. Near the end of the attack the child raises, or
vomits a mass of stringy, glutinous mucus. After it
is over the child is exhausted, there is a more or less
profuse perspiration, and he may be quite dazed. These
attacks are, as a rule, more frequent and more severe
during the night. This stage lasts about one month and
is then followed by the stage of decline, during which
the disease subsides into what appears as an ordinary
bronchial cold.</p>

<p>It is quite common for these children to get relapses,
especially during inclement winter weather, and go on
whooping for two or three months longer. Their vitality
suffers because their sleep and nourishment is interfered
with, and they become nervous and difficult to manage.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Inasmuch as there is no remedy known
that will cure whooping-cough, the best we can do is
to render the patient physically efficient to stand the
severe strain of coughing, which is the worst feature
of the disease. Experience has taught us that those
children do best who spend their entire time out of doors.
We, therefore, advise parents to encourage their children
to play in the open air. There is no exception to
this rule, even in winter weather, unless it is particularly
inclement. If the weather is wet or raw, or if the
child has bronchitis, or is running a fever, it would be
more safe to keep the child indoors, in a well-aired
room, until the temporary conditions pass over, when
they could again resume the open-air treatment.</p>

<p>Naturally delicate children if under two years of age
should not risk staying out of doors too much in very
cold or raw weather, even if not suffering from any of
the above complications.</p>

<p>The bedrooms of children suffering from whooping-cough
should be large and thoroughly aired day and
night.</p>

<p>The nourishment in these cases is of great importance.
They should be carefully fed, and if they vomit with
the paroxysms of coughing, they should be fed small
quantities frequently. Any form of digestive disturbance
is very apt to accentuate the frequency of coughing.
A fluid diet of milk is the best. Milk punches
aid in keeping up the strength; malted milk and eggs
beaten in milk are nutritious and easily digested.</p>

<p>So far as internal medication is concerned, I have
found pertussin to be the most efficacious remedy. If
it is begun early and in sufficient dosage, it not only
favors an early termination of the disease, but it lessens
the frequency and the severity of the paroxysms. If it
is suspected that the child has been exposed to whooping-cough,
pertussin may be given during the catarrhal
stage with the advantage that it will render the whole
course of the disease milder. If it is given during the
course of an ordinary catarrhal cold, it will in most
cases be as effectual as any ordinary cough remedy. The
dosage should be large enough to produce results. I
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a>]</span>
have found a teaspoonful every two hours to a child of
three years to be the average dose. In older children
I give two teaspoonfuls every three hours. It is necessary
to continue its use throughout the disease. The
taste of pertussin is pleasant and young children take
it willingly.</p>

<p>When the disease is inclined to a protracted course,
or when the cough does not subside, especially during
unfavorable weather, it is of great importance to send
the child away. A change of climate, preferably to the
seashore, even for a short time, will act like a charm,
and will cure the cough of whooping-cough quicker than
any other possible measure.</p>


<h4>MEASLES</h4>

<p>Measles is the most widely prevalent, eruptive, contagious
disease. With few exceptions, every human being
"gets" measles. As an uncomplicated disease it is never
fatal, and is not even regarded as dangerous. Because
of this characteristic, however, parents are neglectful
and complications occur, and these frequently prove fatal.
One attack renders the patient immune. It is very
highly contagious and spreads with great rapidity among
those who have never had it. It is not possible to carry
the disease any great distance by a third person or by
means of living objects. It does not, however, cling to
clothing or other objects as long as scarlet fever. Its
period of incubation is from eleven to fourteen days.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;The symptoms develop gradually. A
severe cold in the head is the first and most characteristic
symptom of the disease. There is a discharge from the
nose, swollen and watery eyes, sneezing and a hoarse,
harsh cough. The patient may complain of the throat
being painful and examination will reveal a general congestion
of the parts. There are also headache, lassitude,
pains in the back, and there may be vomiting and diarrhea.
Children in the early stages of measles are tired
and sleepy.</p>

<p><b>Koplik's Spots</b>.&mdash;Three or four days, in rare cases
somewhat longer, before the appearance of the rash there
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a>]</span>
appears on the mucous membrane of the cheeks small,
bluish white, or yellowish white points, the size of a
small pin head. These points are surrounded with reddened
areas which give the appearance of a general rash
with fine white points upon it. These points resemble
milk particles. They adhere firmly to the mucous membrane
and when an effort is made to remove them it is
found that the underlying surface is ulcerated and excoriated.</p>

<p>The Koplik spots are not of much value to the mother
other than that they may be relied upon to indicate the
coming disease with which they child is affected. Physicians
look for them as an aid in diagnosis before the
rash would of itself indicate the disease.</p>

<p>The rash appears on the third, fourth, or fifth day of
the disease. From the day of the infection to the outbreak
of the rash about thirteen days intervene. It is
seen first at the roots of the hair on the forehead, behind
the ears or on the neck. It may be seen first on the
cheeks. The beginning rash appears as small, dark red,
dull spots. At first there are only a few, but they soon
become more numerous, they join together, and soon the
surface looks inflamed as if entirely covered with the
rash. The rash covers the entire body, including the
soles and palms. In twenty-four hours it is at its height
on the face. It spreads downward like a wave, first the
face, then the neck and chest, then the abdomen and later
the legs. By the time it invades the legs it has begun
to fade on the face. It fades slowly in the order of its
appearance. Its duration is about four days.</p>

<p>The skin is swollen; it burns and itches. The eyes
are swollen and red and intensely sensitive to light.
There is usually a muco-pus discharge from them. The
cough is invariably an annoying feature. The fever is
high and reaches its highest point when the rash is at
its height. As the rash fades the fever subsides.</p>

<p>When the rash fades, the patient begins to "scale."
The scales of measles are fine, like bran, never in large
patches like the scales of scarlet fever. The amount of
the scaling varies. It may be quite considerable or it
may be so small as to be overlooked.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Complications</b>.&mdash;The most important and by far the
most frequent complication of measles is broncho-pneumonia.
There may be various conditions affecting the
stomach, bowels, throat, ears, bronchi, and the nervous
system, which may accompany the disease but are seldom
of a serious or important character.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Measles runs a certain course and will
run that course, no matter what we may or may not do.
We cannot stop it, or shorten it, or lessen its severity.
We can only hope to make the patient comfortable and
to prevent the development of complications.</p>

<p>The child should be put in bed and kept comfortably
warm but not too warm. The room should be kept at
the ordinary temperature of the sick room, 68&deg; to 70&deg; F.
It should be darkened but not dark. The food should be
fluid and given regularly. The child may be given all
the cool,&mdash;not cold,&mdash;water it wants to drink. The bowels
should be kept open daily. If constipation occurs an
enema may be given. The eyes must be carefully
watched and washed every hour or two during the day
with a boracic acid solution. If the cough is distressing,
it may be rendered less distressing, though we cannot
hope to stop it until the disease has run its course. The
restlessness, headache and general discomfort can be
much modified by suitable remedies. If the itching is
acute, the body can be rubbed with carbolated vaseline.
When the rash subsides and the patient is free from
fever a daily warm bath should be given in order to facilitate
scaling.</p>

<p>Should complications arise they should be promptly
cared for by the attending physician.</p>


<p><b>SUMMARY</b>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>1. Measles is the most prevalent infectious disease
of childhood.</p>

<p>2. The danger of measles has been and is underestimated.
Because of its prevalency many mothers
treat it with less respect than they should, with
the result that fatal complications occur, or the
future health of the child is permanently injured.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a>]</span></p>


<p>3. Children with measles should be put in bed and
kept in bed and treated as directed above.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following rules have been formulated by the Department
of Health of New York City, with reference
to measles, and embody precautions that should find general
observance:</p>

<blockquote><p>1. All children in the family must be promptly
excluded from school attendance.</p>

<p>2. Careful and continued isolation of the patient must be
enforced until the case is terminated and fumigation has been
ordered by the medical inspector of the Department.</p>

<p>3. All secondary cases must be reported even if the first
case is still under surveillance of the Department of Health.</p>

<p>4. Suspected cases must be treated as contagious cases
until a sufficiently long observation has shown that the patient
has a non-contagious disease. All cases will be considered
as measles, if so reported. Any change in the original
diagnosis must be made in writing to the Department of
Health and must be confirmed by a diagnostician.</p>

<p>5. Physicians must not order the removal of patients to
the contagious disease hospital, or elsewhere, in cabs or other
vehicles, but must notify the Department of Health and the
removal will be effected by a coup&eacute; or ambulance of the
Department.</p>

<p>6. Whenever there is a case of measles in rooms in the
rear of, or communicating with, a store, the inspector is required
to have the store closed at once, or to report the case
for immediate removal to the hospital.</p>

<p>7. A case of measles must not be removed from one house
to another, or even to a different apartment in the same
house, without the permission of the Department. Such removal
is in direct violation of the provisions of the Sanitary
Code.</p>

<p>8. No case of measles shall be discharged from observation
until the Department has been notified, the case examined
by an inspector to see if desquamation is entirely
completed, and the premises ordered fumigated. This examination
by the inspector is necessary because the Department
of Health must have official information as to the
completion of desquamation before a child is dismissed from
observation. Other people with children demand this protection.
At no other time is the inspector allowed to examine
the patient. In any case, however, where isolation
has not been maintained and it becomes necessary to remove
the patient to the hospital, a diagnostician will make
an examination.</p>

<p>It is recommended that physicians provide a special washable
gown for each case of measles. This gown should be
put on before entering the sick-room and taken off outside
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a>]</span>
the sick-room as soon as the visit is completed. The gown
should be kept in a closet or suitable place, separate from all
other clothing, and the gown, and the closet should be fumigated
after the termination of the case.</p>

<p>10. In private houses only fumigation may be performed
under the supervision of the attending physician; provided
he follow accurately the directions given in the following
rules and regulations. Upon request a blank will be provided
upon which he must state the manner and extent of the
work performed under his orders and supervision. If satisfactory
to the Department, this will be accepted in place of
fumigation by the Department. It is essential, however, that
he should know that the disinfection has been efficiently
carried out.</p></blockquote>

<p>In every case of fumigation the following regulations
must be complied with:</p>

<blockquote><p>All cracks or crevices in rooms to be fumigated
must be sealed or calked, to prevent the escape of the disinfectant,
and one of the following disinfectants used in the quantities
named:</p>

<p>a. Sulphur, 4 lbs., for every 1,000 cubic feet of air space, 8
hours' exposure.</p>

<p>b. Formaline, 6 oz. for every 1,000 cubic feet of air space,
4 hours' exposure.</p>

<p>c. Paraform, 1,000 grains for every 1,000 cubic feet of air
space, 6 hours' exposure.</p>

<p>The following disinfecting solutions may be used for
goods, which are afterwards to be washed:</p>

<p>a. Carbolic acid, 2 to 5 per cent.</p>

<p>b. Bichloride of mercury, 1-1,000.</p></blockquote>


<h4>SCARLET FEVER. SCARLATINA.</h4>

<p>Scarlet fever is an acute, contagious disease. It begins
abruptly. The child may have a severe attack and
be quite sick from the beginning, or he may have a mild
attack and not be very sick. Usually the fever rises
rapidly, the child vomits and complains of a sore throat.
If the attack is very mild the throat symptoms may not
cause any distress. Frequently, about the third day,
there are patches on the tonsils. Prostration may be
profound if the fever is very high. Convulsions and
diarrhea are sometimes present in very young patients.
It takes from two to six days to develop scarlet fever
from the time the child is exposed to it. The disease
may be caught at any time, but it is most contagious
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a>]</span>
during the time the patient is scaling. It is not as contagious
as measles. Some children seem to escape even
though directly exposed to it. It is more frequent in
the fall and during the winter, and it is more severe
during the latter months.</p>

<p><b>Eruption</b>.&mdash;The eruption appears at any time after
twelve hours. It may not, however, appear before the
third or fourth day. It lasts from three to seven days,
and only takes a few hours to cover the whole body after
it is first seen. The rash is first seen on the neck or
chest; it appears as a red, uniform blush, but, when examined
closely, small reddish spots may be seen all over
it. If the rash is very faint and of a doubtful character
a hot bath may bring it out. A bright red, well-developed
rash is a sign of good heart action. In the event
of heart failure, the rash fades quickly. Itching is a
constant symptom after the rash is fully out.</p>

<p>About the eighth day the rash begins to scale or desquamate.
It begins on the neck and chest. It takes
from one to three weeks to scale completely, from the
time it begins to peel. The hands and feet are the last
spots to scale.</p>

<p>It must always be kept in mind that mild cases are
just as contagious as severe cases, and that a mild case
may cause in another person a very severe attack.</p>

<p>The throat may be mildly affected or it may be the
most troublesome feature of the case. It is red and
swollen and the child complains of pain during the act
of swallowing. Patches may be seen on the tonsils on
the third day. There is usually a discharge from the
nose and this discharge may be contagious. While the
fever is high, the child is restless, complains of thirst,
and may be slightly delirious.</p>

<p>One attack is usually all a child has during life, though
there are exceptions to this rule. Complications are
quite frequent with scarlet fever. Inflammation of the
ears and kidneys is most often met.</p>

<p><b>Measures to be Taken to Prevent Spread of Disease</b>.&mdash;Every
case, no matter how mild, should be isolated
for four weeks. Many cases must be isolated longer,&mdash;until
scaling is complete. Children should not play or
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a>]</span>
sleep with other children for three or four weeks after
all symptoms have been absent. Other children in the
family, who have not been exposed, should be sent away.
All clothing should be changed and washed in soap and
water and then boiled in a carbolic solution. The nurse
should not mix freely with other members of the family.
The sick room should be kept clean, and well aired. It
should be dusted with a wet cloth, and this should afterwards
be burned. There should be no furniture, or
hangings, or pictures in the room other than are absolutely
necessary. The room should not be used after
the case is over until it is thoroughly and completely disinfected.</p>

<p>During the period of scaling the patient should be
rubbed all over with carbolated vaseline. This allays
itching and prevents the scales flying around. The bed
sheet can be taken off daily with the scales in it, and
immediately put in carbolic water and boiled.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Inasmuch as scarlet fever is one of the
most dangerous and one of the most treacherous diseases
of childhood, we cannot afford to take any chances with
it. Every child with scarlet fever should be put in bed,
and kept there during the entire illness,&mdash;that is, from
four to six weeks. Light, and the free circulation of
fresh air are absolutely necessary for the proper care of
a scarlet fever case. The child should be clothed only
with the usual night gown and a light undershirt. No
extra wraps or blankets are required.</p>

<p>The diet should be reduced in quantity and strength.
The bowels should move daily. If anything is necessary
to accomplish this, citrate of magnesia is quite satisfactory.
There is no special medicine for the treatment of
this disease. Often it is not necessary to give any.
Good nursing is more essential, and with proper attention
to the bowels, diet, fresh air, clothing, sleep, and
quiet, all will, as a rule, result favorably. Quiet is essential.
Consequently, two persons at a time should
never be allowed in the room with the little patient.</p>

<p>The family physician will prescribe whatever medicine
is necessary in his judgment, and will meet any complication
as it arises.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a>]</span></p>

<h4>TYPHOID FEVER</h4>

<p>Typhoid fever is an acute infectious disease. It is
rare in infancy. After the fifth year it is more common.
It is caused by drinking infected water or milk. It is
not a serious disease in childhood, rarely being fatal.</p>

<p><b>Symptoms</b>.&mdash;It may begin suddenly or it may come on
slowly. If suddenly, the child develops what appears
to be an attack of indigestion, has fever, vomiting, and is
prostrated. In cases developing slowly the child complains
of being tired, has a headache, nausea, and fever.
Vomiting is the suggestive and important symptom.</p>

<p>Diarrhea is usually present. Constipation, however,
may accompany the entire illness. Children may not
complain of an excess of gas as do adults. The abdomen
is tender. The typhoid eruption is rarely seen
in children. They lose flesh steadily and then strength
diminishes rapidly. Headache and delirium at night are
quite common, and the child is dull and indifferent, and
often in a state of semi-stupor.</p>

<p>In order to tell definitely whether the child has typhoid,
it is necessary to make a blood examination.
There are so many intestinal conditions in children that
simulate typhoid, that a blood examination is imperative.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;The patient should remain in bed during
the time fever is present and for a few days after. A
fluid diet, preferably milk, is the most suitable means of
nourishing the child. It may be diluted or given plain
according to the age of the patient. Water is essential
and should be given freely.</p>

<p>The discharges of the patient should be thoroughly
disinfected in a solution of carbolic acid, 1-20. All
clothing and bed linen should be boiled for two hours.
If the fever remains high cold sponging is advisable.
The attending physician should instruct regarding this
feature, as some children do not stand cold applications
well.</p>

<p>The average duration of the disease is about six weeks.</p>

<p><b>How to Keep From Getting and Spreading Typhoid
Fever</b>.&mdash;Typhoid fever is a communicable disease, but,
if certain precautions are taken, its contraction
and spread can almost certainly be prevented.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a>]</span></p>

<p>The disease is caused by a specific germ known as the
typhoid bacillus. These germs are found in the excreta
(stools and urine) of persons ill with typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Failure to properly disinfect these excreta and carelessness
in the care of persons ill with typhoid fever
lead to the transmission of the disease from the sick to
the well by the infection of water, milk or food with the
typhoid bacillus or by direct contact.</p>

<p>The disease is contracted by taking into the mouth
in some form the discharges from some previous case.
There is no other way. It is, therefore, a disease of
filth and someone is at fault somewhere for every case
of typhoid fever that occurs.</p>

<p>Bad sanitary conditions, such as lack of drainage, open
cess-pools, sewer gas, decaying vegetable matter, etc.,
may favor the contraction of the disease, but cannot
cause it unless the specific germ, the typhoid bacillus,
is present.</p>

<p>The water supply of a community becomes infected
by the entrance into it of the excreta (stools and urine)
of persons suffering from typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Milk (in which typhoid bacilli grow and multiply very
rapidly) usually becomes infected by washing out milk
cans with water in which these bacilli are present, or
from the presence of the bacilli on the hands or persons
of those handling milk. Oysters spread the disease when
they have been "freshed" in water rich in sewage and
containing the typhoid bacillus. Flies, whose bodies
have become foul with typhoid excreta, may infect food,
milk, etc. Those who take care of typhoid patients
may contract the disease if they do not at once disinfect
their hands after handling the patient, or clothing
or bedding which has become soiled with the discharges.</p>

<p><b>How to Keep From Getting Typhoid Fever</b>.&mdash;If the
chance of infection is to be reduced to a minimum, all
drinking water, concerning the character of which there
may be the slightest doubt, should be boiled, and all milk,
the handling and care of which is not absolutely beyond
suspicion, should be pasteurized or boiled. All food
supplies (meat, milk, vegetables, etc.), should be carefully
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a>]</span>
protected against flies, and flies should not be permitted
access to the sick-room, the kitchen nor to the
room in which the meals are eaten. Bathing at all
beaches which have sewers emptying in their immediate
vicinity should be strictly avoided. In the majority of
cases it is probable that the system must be slightly below
par in order that the disease may be contracted;
therefore, all indigestible food, green fruit, etc., which
may set up indigestion or diarrhea, and so render the
system more susceptible to infection, should be avoided.
In addition, the elementary rules of cleanliness and hygiene,
both as to the house and person, should be most
strictly observed. No member of a household in which
a case of typhoid fever occurs should take food in any
form without previously washing the hands.</p>

<p>Typhoid bacilli enter the body only through the mouth.
If sufficient care be taken to prevent their entrance, the
contraction of the disease can be absolutely prevented.</p>

<p><b>How to Keep From Spreading the Disease</b>.&mdash;In order
to protect themselves and others in the household, persons
caring for or in any way coming into contact with
a case of typhoid fever must constantly bear in mind
that the secretions and excretions (urine, stools, etc.),
of the patient contain typhoid bacilli and are capable of
transmitting the disease to others. The person who
nurses the patient should not do the cooking for the
family. The bedding used by the patient should be
washed separately from that used by others. Special
dishes, plates, knives, forks, etc., should be kept for the
use of the patient alone, and should be washed separately
and thoroughly. Particular attention should be paid to
immediate disinfection of the stools and urine of the patients
until the restoration of health is complete.</p>

<p>The urine is especially dangerous. It may look entirely
normal and yet contain typhoid bacilli for some
time after recovery is apparently complete. In a few
instances the typhoid bacilli may persist in the stools for
weeks or months after recovery. Such persons are called
"typhoid carriers," and constitute a grave menace to the
health of the community. The best disinfectants are
carbolic acid and freshly slacked lime; both are effectual,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">[626]</a></span>
cheap and easily obtained. Urine or stools to which has
been added one-third of their volume of a solution of
one part of carbolic acid to twenty parts of water are, as
a rule, sufficiently disinfected in half an hour, provided
the mass of the stool is broken up and thoroughly mixed
with the solutions. The best method is to keep the urinal
of bed-pan partly filled with the disinfecting solution
at all times. In this way any germs present in the urine
or stools are almost instantly destroyed. Stools and
urine should never be thrown out on the ground. If no
system of drainage is at hand, they should be very thoroughly
disinfected and emptied into a hole in the ground
and covered with earth. All persons nursing or handling
the patient in any way should be careful to wash their
hands very thoroughly with soap and water before leaving
the sick-room. They should never, while in the sick-room,
touch any article of food or put their hands to
their mouths. Careful observation of the above suggestions
and precautions will almost certainly prevent
contraction of typhoid fever or the spread of the disease.</p>


<h4>VARIOUS SOLUTIONS</h4>

<p><b>Boracic Acid Solution</b>.&mdash;In the previous pages mothers
are frequently told to use "a saturated solution of
boracic acid." A saturated solution means that the water
in the solution has dissolved all of the product that
is put into it that it is capable of dissolving. When boracic
acid is put into water, the water will dissolve it up
to a certain point; if you add more the boracic acid will
not dissolve; it will float if it is in the form of powder,
or it will remain at the bottom of the glass if it is crystal&mdash;in
other words the water is saturated to its limit and
the solution is known as a saturated solution.</p>

<p>The strength of a saturated solution of boracic acid is
as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Boracic Acid</td><td align='left'>Ounces</td>
<td align='left'>1-1/2</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Hot Sterile Water</td><td align='left'>Pints</td>
<td align='left'>2</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>which means that 2 pints of hot water will completely
dissolve 1-1/2 ounces of boracic acid. If any more boracic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">[627]</a></span>
acid is added the water will not dissolve it because it is
already "saturated." Inasmuch, however, as boracic acid
is harmless, it is perfectly safe to use the liquid part of a
solution which contains some undissolved acid.</p>

<p>A saturated solution is used in the eyes after it is
strained.</p>

<p><b>Normal Salt Solution</b>.&mdash;A normal salt solution is made
in the following proportions:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Sodium Chloride (ordinary table salt)</td>
<td align='left'>Grains</td><td align='left'>128</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Sterile Water</td><td align='left'>Pints</td>
<td align='left'>2</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Normal salt solution is much used in irrigating the
bowel. A mother may safely use it in the proportion of
one heaping teaspoonful to two quarts of water&mdash;two
quarts being the size of the ordinary fountain syringe.</p>

<p><b>Carron Oil</b>.&mdash;Lime water and raw linseed oil, equal
parts. This mixture is much used in burns. It should
be made fresh.</p>

<p><b>Thiersch's Solution</b>:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Salicylic Acid</td><td align='left'>Drams</td>
<td align='left'>1/2</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Boracic Acid</td><td align='left'>Drams</td>
<td align='left'>3</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Sterile Water</td><td align='left'>Pints</td>
<td align='left'>2</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Thiersch's solution is a good, mild antiseptic solution,
or wash.</p>

<p><b>Solution of Bichloride of Mercury (1 to 1000)</b>:&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Bichloride of Mercury</td><td align='left'>Grains
15</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Common Salt</td><td align='left'>Grains</td>
<td align='left'>15</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Sterile Water</td><td align='left'>Pints</td>
<td align='left'>2</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Bichloride of mercury is one of the most powerful
and poisonous drugs. Solutions made from it should
never be used without special directions from a physician.
In much weaker solutions than the above it is one
of the best antiseptic washes known. It is used to disinfect
wounds, for douches, and for various other purposes,
but always by special direction of a physician.</p>

<p><b>Other solutions</b>.&mdash;Frequently mothers are directed to
use solutions in the proportion of 1 to 500, or 1 to 1000.</p>

<p>This means that there will be one part of the drug, or of
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a>]</span>
the liquid medicine, to 500, or 1000 parts of water. For
example if you were asked to make up a solution of bichloride
of mercury in the strength of 1 to 4000, you
would use one ounce of bichloride of mercury to four
thousand ounces of water, or one grain of the mercury
to four thousand drops of water,&mdash;one grain being equivalent
to one drop.</p>

<p>Sometimes solutions are made up on the percentage
basis. For example, a five per cent. solution of carbolic
acid. In this case it would be necessary to take five
ounces of carbolic to one hundred ounces of water, or
five drops of carbolic to one hundred drops of water.</p>

</div>
<p><b>Contents of the Family Medicine Chest</b>.&mdash;The family
medicine cabinet should contain the following articles:
a graduate, medicine droppers, hot water bags, a flat ice
bag, a fountain syringe, a Davidson's syringe, a baby
syringe, sterile gauze, absorbent cotton, gauze bandages
of various widths, a yard of oiled silk, one roll of one
inch "Z O" adhesive plaster, a bottle of Pearson's creolin,
hydrogen peroxide (fresh), one ounce tincture of iodine
in an air-tight bottle, a can of Colman's mustard, two
ounces of syrup of ipecac, a bottle of castor oil (fresh),
one pound of boracic acid powder, one pound of boracic
acid crystal, a bottle of glycerine, a bottle of white vaseline,
a bath thermometer, some good whisky or brandy,
aromatic spirits of ammonia, smelling salts, pure sodium
bicarbonate, oil of cloves for an aching gum or toothache,
a bottle of alkolol for mouth wash and gargle, and one
ounce of the following ointment for use in the various
emergencies which occur in all homes,&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>

<p>This ointment may be applied to all cuts, bruises, skin
eruptions, chafings and sores of minor importance. It is
one of the best applications for chafing of the skin in
babies.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a>]</span></p>

<p>The medicine chest should also contain a small jar of
Unguentine for burns; one-tenth grain calomel tablets
for a cathartic for baby to be used as explained in the text
of the book, or as advised by the physician. It may also
contain tablets for colds and for other purposes as suggested
by the family physician. It should never contain
medicines the use of which is not thoroughly understood
by the mother. It is a wrong practice for mothers
to keep medicines to use for the same ailment at a subsequent
time. The ailment may not be the same and frequently
the medicine itself deteriorates, or it may get
stronger with age. Many medicines are made with alcohol
in them. If kept for some time the alcohol evaporates
and leaves a concentrated mixture which, if given in the
dose meant for the fresh preparation, may poison a child.
Such cases of poisoning are on record. The same argument
applies to powders. Certain drugs lose their
strength, some absorb moisture, others change their chemical
strength if kept mixed with other chemicals. They
should be thrown away after the case is over if they
have not been used. It is a dangerous practice to keep
medicines around if there are children in the family.</p>

<p><b>Foreign Bodies in the Eye</b>.&mdash;Particles which accidentally
lodge in the eye are usually located on the under
surface of the upper lid. They are sometimes, however,
found on the ball of the eye or on the inner aspect of
the lower lid. Foreign bodies which are propelled into
the eye with great force, as iron specks which railroad
men frequently get sometimes imbed themselves into
the eye-ball and have to be cut out or dug out. The
entrance of the foreign particle is always accompanied by
a flow of tears which is nature's way of removing them.
The offending object may escape through the tear duct
into the nose, or it may be simply washed out with the
flow of tears. Rubbing the well eye will cause a flow of
tears in both eyes and may facilitate removal of the foreign
matter. Blowing the nose may force the particle
into the tear duct. The use of the eye cup may help in
ridding the eye of the body. The same object may be
accomplished if the eyes are immersed in a basin of
water and opened wide. Then by moving the eyes
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a>]</span>
around the particle may be washed out. If the particle is
located on the under surface of the upper lid it may be
promptly removed by pulling the upper lid forcibly down
and over the lower lid. The eyelashes of the lower lid
act as a brush and as a rule quickly remove the irritant if
the procedure is carried out adroitly. Everting the
upper lid is a means of locating the body and in making
possible its removal by a small camel's hair brush or corner
of a handkerchief. To evert the upper lid it is
necessary to employ a guide. A match stem may be used
in an emergency. This is laid across the middle of the
upper lid, the eye lashes are grasped with the fingers of
the other hand and the lid is bent over the match stem
and turned up thus everting or turning inside out the
entire upper lid. The procedure may be facilitated if the
patient is instructed to look down while the operator is
drawing the eye-lid upward.</p>

<p>If the particle cannot be easily removed by any of the
above methods it is not safe for an uninstructed individual
to go any further. The eye is an exceedingly delicate
organ and may be permanently injured by unnecessary
irritation. It is always safer and it may be cheaper in the
long run to consult a competent oculist in such cases.</p>

<p>After the removal of any object from the eye, it is desirable
to frequently wash it out with a saturated solution
of boracic acid. This mixture will allay any inflammation
and will tend to restore the normal condition more quickly
and more satisfactorily than if the eye were left to heal
itself.</p>

<p><b>Foreign Bodies in the Ear</b>.&mdash;When a foreign body
gets into the ear mothers are unnecessarily alarmed because
of a failure to appreciate that the ear is a closed
passage. It is impossible for any object to get into the
ear itself; the depth of the external passage is only about
one inch in an adult. At this point the passage is completely
closed by the drum membrane. Most of the harm
is done by ignorant meddling, not by the object itself.</p>

<p>Children frequently put foreign bodies in the ear, as,
buttons, pebbles, beans, cherry stones, coffee, etc. The
very first thing for the mother to do when she learns that
her child has put "something" in its ear is to keep cool,
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">632</a>]</span>
and try to find out what the something is. It is essential
to know what the article is because different articles are
treated differently. For example if we try to remove a
bean or pea with a syringe, the liquid will cause the
pea or bean to swell and result in wedging it in so firmly
that it will be impossible to dislodge it in this way.</p>

<p>If the object is hard, as a marble, button, pebble, bead,
the greatest care must be exercised. Try to make the
object fall out. To effect this, turn the child's head
downward with the injured ear toward the floor. Then
pull the lobe of the ear outward and backward so as to
straighten the canal. A teaspoonful of olive oil poured
into the ear will aid in its expulsion. If after the oil is
poured in, the head is suddenly turned as above described
the object will fall out. A very effective way to remove
a hard object is to take a small camel's hair brush and
coat the end with glue, or any other adhesive substance,
then place it in contact with the object and permit it
to remain long enough to become firmly attached after
which it may be gently pulled out with the object attached.
Never employ an instrument in the ear to remove
a foreign body.</p>

<p>When a live insect or fly enters the ear a number of
safe methods may be developed. If the ear is immediately
turned to a bright light the insect may come out of
its own accord. It may be floated out with salt water, or
it may be smothered with sweet oil or castor oil after
which it may be floated or syringed out. If it is necessary
to employ a syringe this should be used gently. A
foreign body may remain in the ear for days or weeks
without doing any harm. This suggests that any unnecessary
poking or prying should not be undertaken,
because this may wedge it in tighter and to injure the
drum membrane.</p>

<p><b>Foreign Bodies in the Nose</b>.&mdash;Children may put any
of these articles into the nose. Very often they do, and
do not know enough to tell. If such is the case the first
symptom calling attention to the fact that something is
wrong is the appearance of a thick foul discharge from
one nostril or some obstruction to breathing on the same
side.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a>]</span></p>

<p>When the foreign body may be seen the child should be
made to blow the nose, first closing the well side with the
finger. If this does not expel the object the child should
be made to sneeze by tickling the free nostril with a
feather or by taking snuff. The mother should never permit
the use of instruments by one unskilled in an effort
to rid the nose of an obstruction. There is great danger
of seriously injuring the delicate structure of the nose in
this way or of pushing the object so far in that it may
necessitate an operation to extract it. It is much safer
to seek medical aid before any damage is effected. It
seldom does harm to wait until the right assistance is
at hand; it often does serious harm to be too smart in
these little matters.</p>

<p><b>Foreign Bodies in the Throat</b>.&mdash;If the foreign body is
in the upper part of the throat and can be seen it may
be removed with any instrument that can grasp it. The
child may be immediately held up by its feet when the
article may be shaken out. If it is further back or in
the air passages the child should be made to vomit by
tickling the throat with a feather or with the finger held
in the throat till it does vomit.</p>

<p>When the object interferes with breathing a physician
should be sent for in a hurry. In the meantime the
family may try to dislodge it by having the child bend
forward or by holding it with the head downward and,
while in this position, sharply striking the back with each
cough. Striking the chest when in this position may
effect the same purpose. If no success follows this procedure
try the reverse position. Have the child bend
backward over the arm of a sofa, for example, or put
him in bed with the body hanging out of the bed face
upward. If none of these effect relief you must depend
upon the skill of the physician.</p>

<p><b>A Bruise or Contusion</b>.&mdash;A bruise or contusion is an
injury to the tissues underneath the skin, but this does
not imply that the skin itself is opened or damaged. In
every bruise the small blood vessels are ruptured, and
the blood collects in the tissues causing distention, swelling
and pain. The blood is held in the tissues, it is stagnant,
becomes dark in color and so produces the bluish
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">634</a>]</span>
discoloration that we see in all bruises. The color varies
according to the extent of the collected blood. At first it
is red and inflamed looking, then purple, then black, then
greenish and finally citron. The so-called "black-eye" is
a typical example of this degree of bruise. After a
bruise the parts swell from the collection of blood and
from the accompanying inflammation. This causes pain
which persists for a day although the spot may be sore
and tender for a week or more.</p>

<p>In all mild varieties home remedies may suffice, but
in the more serious and extensive bruises it is advisable
to seek medical assistance. It is essential to completely
put the part to rest and to elevate it. This will relieve
the pain and favor the absorption of the exuded blood.
If the bruise is on the foot, the leg should be elevated until
the foot is higher than the hip. If, on the hand, it
should be so held that it will be higher than the elbow and
it may frequently be held higher than the shoulder to relieve
the throbbing and the pain.</p>

<p>As a rule, cold should be applied as soon after the injury
as possible, cloths wrung out of ice water, or a piece
of ice may be bound on the part for a short time. The
object of the cold is to stop the internal bleeding. If
the injury is slight, as are most of the injuries of the
household, the mother may apply repeated cloths wrung
out of very hot water. This procedure tends to aid the
immediate absorption of the blood and prevents a discoloration
of the part. If there is great pain relief may
be afforded by applying a firm bandage saturated in the
lead-water and laudanum mixture which may be obtained
in the drug store under the name of lead and opium
wash. The bruised part should be massaged every day
and a simple ointment may be applied to soften the inflamed
area.</p>

<p>If any complication arises in the treatment of a bruise,
it will be necessary to consult a physician.</p>

<p><b>Wounds</b>.&mdash;A wound implies an injury to the skin in
addition to injury to the underlying parts to a lesser or
greater extent. The skin may be opened by cutting, or
stabbing wounds; or it may be punctured, torn, contused,
or bruised open. These injuries are effected in
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a>]</span>
various ways. We speak of machinery or mechanical
wounds, or gunshot wounds, bites, cuts, stabs and other
varieties of wounds.</p>

<p>It is very important to know exactly how a wound is
produced and the nature of the instrument which opened
the skin. We try to obtain this information in order to
estimate the probable degree of poison that may or may
not have entered into the wound.</p>

<p>The first thing to do in treating wounds is to stop the
bleeding. If the patient is suffering from shock he
should be given active treatment for this condition as
described elsewhere. If the wound contains any foreign
bodies these should be removed. The wound
should then be cleansed, closed and dressed and kept at
rest. If the wound is poisoned, or if there is any fear
that lockjaw may arise, or if the wound has been caused
by a mad dog it will require special treatment.</p>

<p>It is far better not to interfere if you do not know
what to do than to do harm. One should offer no advice
if they are not qualified to give advice. Much harm
has resulted from doing the wrong thing in these cases.
The instruction in the following pages is given so that
the average mother may know what to do in emergency
but not with the intention that she may regard her knowledge
as sufficient to dispense with the aid of the physician.</p>

<p><b>Arrest of Hemorrhage</b>.&mdash;When there is a wound there
is always bleeding; this means that some blood vessels
have been cut or torn open allowing blood to escape.
The character of the hemorrhage will determine the nature
of the treatment to be employed. On general principles,
the first thing to do in the presence of bleeding is
to elevate the part, if that is possible. If there is simply
a general oozing of blood, it may be controlled and
arrested by pressure. This pressure should be steady
and prolonged. It is best accomplished by wetting a
clean handkerchief or a pad of gauze in ice cold water,
placing this on the part and binding it on firmly with a
bandage.</p>

<p>If the discharge of blood flows in a steady stream and
is rather dark the hemorrhage is coming from a vein.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a>]</span>
We know that veins carry blood toward the heart so
that any pressure or constriction employed to stop a
venous hemorrhage should be tied on the side of the
wound further removed from the heart. Inasmuch as
veins have soft walls the right kind of pressure will in
most instances stop the bleeding. The part should be
elevated after the pad is adjusted in place. Any tight
band on the limb as a garter or sleeve band should be
removed as they tend to interrupt the return circulation.</p>

<p>If the hemorrhage is from an artery the blood is bright
red. It spurts out forcibly, is difficult to control and demands
immediate attention. Arteries carry the blood
from the heart to the extremities. They beat with every
pulsation of the heart so that blood coming from an
artery spurts with every pulse beat. Even a small
artery may be responsible for a very considerable hemorrhage
in a very short time. Whatever is done must be
done quickly. The parts should be freed from all clothing
and if possible elevated. Pressure may be tried, if
it succeeds it must be strong and steady pressure. The
point to press must be on the heart side of the bleeding
artery since the blood stream is coming that way&mdash;this
the mother will note is the reverse from treating bleeding
from a vein as previously explained. The artery
at this point may be felt beating. It is frequently necessary
to clamp the whole limb to stop an arterial hemorrhage.
This may be done in the following manner.
Take a strong piece of cloth or bandage and tie above
the bleeding point. Insert a short piece of stick between
the bandage and the limb and twist around until
the bleeding stops. This should not be kept on longer
than one hour. A tourniquet of this character shuts off
all the blood in the limb and if kept on too long the parts
may mortify. The best means to stop a hemorrhage of
this character is by means of a rubber bandage sold for
the purpose. It is applied by stretching at every turn. It
exerts uniform pressure and in this way does no injury to
the parts. All these measures are, of course, only temporary
expedients as the artery will finally have to be
caught and tied by a physician.</p>

<p><b>Removal of Foreign Bodies From a Wound</b>.&mdash;When
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a>]</span>
the foreign bodies are large enough to be seen they may
be picked out with the fingers after the hands have been
rendered sterile. Smaller bodies may be picked up with
forceps, or they may be washed out with water that has
been boiled and cooled slightly, or a bichloride of mercury
solution in the strength of 1 to 2000 may be used; or a
normal salt solution may be used. As a general rule the
physician should be allowed to undertake this procedure
so that you may not be blamed for something that may
come up later.</p>

<p><b>Cleansing a Wound</b>.&mdash;The simplest way, and the most
effective, to cleanse a wound, no matter how caused, is
to procure a brush and paint it thoroughly with tincture
of iodine. The iodine should be painted right into the
raw wound, it is then bound up and left if it is small and
does not need any stitching. When the physician comes
he can attend to any further procedure that may be
necessary.</p>

<p><b>Closing and Dressing Wounds</b>.&mdash;If the wound is
small, its edges may be drawn together with narrow
strips of adhesive bandage after it has been painted with
iodine. It is then bound up and kept at rest. It should
be inspected the following day to see if it is healing
properly.</p>

<p>If the wound is large or torn, it should be seen by a
physician and dressed and closed by him. All wounds
do better if they are kept at rest.</p>

<p><b>The Condition of Shock</b>.&mdash;When a person suffers a
serious injury, loses a large quantity of blood, or is
subjected to a profound emotion, it affects the vital
powers to such an extent that the individual is said to
be suffering from shock. Shock expresses itself in varying
degrees of apathy. The patient may or may not be
conscious. If conscious he gives no evidence of feeling,
he is silent and motionless although he will respond to
directions and may answer questions. The eyes are dull
and listless, the face pale and pinched, and the general
expression is apathetic. The skin is cold and there may
be perspiration; the pulse is feeble and irregular, and
the breathing is shallow. The whole attitude of the victim
is one of indifference and apparent inability to
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a>]</span>
appreciate the seriousness of the situation and a seeming
immunity to pain or discomfort.</p>

<p>When this condition exists it must always be regarded
as serious because the patient may die as a direct result
of the condition of shock. The various symptoms depend
upon a temporary paralysis of the blood vessels
which deprives the brain of blood. There is always a
certain degree of shock with all injuries. Mothers should
know what to do in these cases before the physician
comes. The general treatment in all cases is to keep the
patient warm and quiet, and to use stimulants carefully.</p>

<p>The patient should be put in bed or on a flat surface
with the feet higher than the head. If raising the feet
should cause the face to become blue it will be advisable
to restore the patient to the horizontal posture. Artificial
heat must be applied to the patient's body and extremities
by means of hot water bags, bottles, bricks, plates, or
any other handy device. Blankets should be put around
the patient and every possible means resorted to, to maintain
body heat. Mustard plasters may be put to the
heart, spine and shins. Stimulants are necessary, such
as hot black coffee if possible or hot water, in which a
small portion of brandy may be put. If brandy is not
obtainable the patient may take aromatic spirits of ammonia
in hot water every twenty minutes for a number
of doses. In every case of shock a physician should be
sent for immediately.</p>

<p><b>Dog Bites</b>.&mdash;When a child is bit by a dog every effort
should be made to get the dog. It should be kept in a
safe place for a week so that it may be definitely known
whether it is sick or not. If the dog dies within a few
days after biting anyone it may be assumed that he had
rabies. Its head should be sent to the local health authorities
who can tell after examination if it was mad. If there
is any reason to assume that the dog was infected, the
child should receive the Pasteur treatment. This treatment
will, if conducted under favorable circumstances,
absolutely prevent hydrophobia.</p>

<p>The mother should sterilize the wound as thoroughly
as possible. This may be done by using pure hydrogen
peroxide. A little piece of absorbent cotton is wound
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a>]</span>
round the end of a tooth-pick or match, dipped in the
peroxide and the incision thoroughly rubbed clean. This
may be done a number of times to ensure thorough
cleansing. No effort should be made to cauterize the
wound. It is not considered proper to employ this
method with dog bites. When the physician examines
the wound he may or may not open it further for more
extensive inspection and sterilization.</p>

<p>Mothers should remember that there are thousands
of bites by dogs that never cause any trouble, and if it
is known that the dog is healthy no worry need trouble
the family. It is also wrong to inform the child of the
probability of hydrophobia. The child may worry himself
sick with fear and if the mother is nervous and excitable
he is apt to be made sick with the dread of what
may follow. It is better, therefore, to remain quiet, to
keep cool, and not to excite the little patient at all.</p>

<p><b>Sprains</b>.&mdash;Every joint is held together by ligaments
which are attached to the bones forming the joint. If
these ligaments are subjected to a sudden twist in a direction
in which the joint is not constructed to move, the
resulting injury is known as a sprain. The ligaments
are stretched, though they may be torn apart and even
small pieces of the bone may be split off if the wrench
is great enough. The injury is an exceedingly painful
one and frequently renders the limb useless for some
time. It is always accompanied with some degree of
swelling and more or less inflammation.</p>

<p>A sprained joint should be immediately put at absolute
rest. The best dressing is the lead and opium wash.
Two pints of it may be obtained at the drug store. Pour
into a large bowl, saturate a large piece of thick absorbent
cotton, wrap around the joint and bind in place.
This dressing may be repeated as often as the cotton
becomes dry. When the swelling has disappeared and
the pain is gone, it is desirable to have the joint supported
with strips of adhesive bandage. These must be put on
in a certain way in order to properly support the joint.
Consequently a physician should put them on. If a sprain
is not attended to effectively there is danger of the joint
being more or less incapacitated for life.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Dislocations</b>.&mdash;A dislocated joint is one that has been
put out of place. It is best to allow a physician to treat
a dislocation. Unskilled handling of a dislocated joint
may not only increase the damage but it may permanently
put the joint out of business. Until the physician arrives
the part should be kept absolutely at rest.</p>

<p><b>Wounds of the Scalp</b>.&mdash;Children frequently get injuries
of the scalp. These wounds bleed freely and as a
rule they occasion a great deal of unnecessary worry
and apprehension. Usually they are not of much importance.
We must keep in mind, however, the probability
of fracture as a consequence of severe injury. The
first thing to do when there is bleeding from the scalp is
to cut or shave away the hair surrounding the wound.
This should be done for an inch around the wound so
that thorough disinfection may be possible. The wound
should now be cleansed as previously instructed and an
effort made to stop the bleeding. The best method is to
first apply pads of gauze wrung out of very hot water.
When success is evident a pad made of boiled cotton
should be placed on the wound and held tightly in place
for some time. If the wound is of such a character as to
demand stitches a physician should of course put them
in.</p>

<p><b>Run-Around: Felon: Whitlow</b>.&mdash;When pus germs
enter around a finger nail and lodge in the soft tissue a
"run-around" is the result. It is accompanied with pain,
swelling, redness and inflammation. The loss of the nail
may follow.</p>

<p>A felon or Whitlow is a more extensive and a more
serious condition. It is not always possible to trace
the cause of a felon. The fact that germs gain an entrance,
however, is soon established. Sometimes a bruise,
or scratch, or a wound is the primary cause. The last joint
of any of the fingers may be the seat of a felon. A
end of the finger becomes hot, tense, swollen and very
painful; the pain is intense if the hand is held down. The
surface may or may not be red. There is as a rule some
fever. If the felon is on the little finger or thumb the
condition is worse than on the others as a rule,&mdash;the inflammation
extending to the hand and often into the arm.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">641</a>]</span>
The condition affects the palmar surface of the fingers.
If the felon results in the "death" of the bone, the last
joint will have to be taken off and the hand may be
distorted, crippled, and rendered permanently disabled.
Blood poison may set in and death is possible as a result
of this complication.</p>

<p><b>Treatment</b>.&mdash;Every effort should be made to abort a
felon. Continuous application of equal parts of alcohol
and water night and day may abort it. Tincture of
iodine applied to the entire end of the finger may be effective.
The hand must be at rest, carried in a sling
during the day and slung over the head to the bed-board
at night. If these efforts are not successful after twenty-four
hours hot poultices should be resorted to, but they
must be changed every twenty minutes. If, at the end of
another twenty-four hours, there is no improvement the
finger must be freely cut open by a surgeon and the
poultices continued.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of "Run-Around."</b>&mdash;Apply iodine freely,
cold applications, and if the inflammation persists use
poultices. It is frequently necessary to incise the run-around.
Patients suffering from either of these conditions
need general tonic treatment and should be under
the care of a physician.</p>

<p><b>Burns and Scalds</b>.&mdash;Burns result from undue exposure
to dry heat. Scalds are produced by the action of hot
liquids and steam.</p>

<p>There are always produced two results from a burn
or a scald. First the local effect, and, second, the general
effect. The general effect may produce shock, the
symptoms of which have been described in the previous
pages. The degree of shock depends upon the extent of
the local injury and may be severe enough to result in
death. If the local injury covers more than two-thirds
of the body death as a rule takes place within two days.</p>

<p><b>How to Extinguish Burning Clothing</b>.&mdash;The thought
to keep in mind is to smother the flames effectively. If
we deprive the flame of all air or oxygen it will immediately
subside. This may be done quickly by wrapping
the burning part in a carpet, rug, blanket, overcoat or
any large woolen material at hand. If none of these
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a>]</span>
articles are at hand the victim may roll on the floor and
try to smother the flame by pressure, aided by the hands.
It is a good plan to throw water on the patient immediately
after the fire has been put out, so as to extinguish
the smoldering fire.</p>

<p>When a person is scalded by steam or boiling water
or other liquid, it is advisable to pour cold water freely
over the wound.</p>

<p><b>How to Remove the Clothing</b>.&mdash;When it is necessary
to remove the clothing it is essential to be gentle in order
not to do greater injury. The clothing must not be pulled.
The garment should be cut so that they fall off. If any
part sticks to the skin, it must be left, not torn away.
Later, it may be removed by moistening it with salt
water.</p>

<p><b>Treatment of Scalds and Burns</b>.&mdash;All slight burns or
scalds may be effectively treated with Unguentine. This
substance may be obtained in any drug store. It is spread
on a cloth and applied directly to the injured part, bound
securely on and renewed every day until the wound is
healed. If Unguentine is not readily obtainable the part
may be covered with any of the following mixtures or
oils: carbolated vaseline, equal parts of linseed oil and
lime water, olive oil, castor oil or kerosene, cloths soaked
in a solution of baking soda, or a solution of phenol
sodique.</p>

<p>In severe burns or scalds the mother should not attempt
to treat the child. A physician should be summoned
at once. The child may be given a little whisky or brandy
in warm water, and if the pain is great a dose of laudanum
may be given. The dose of laudanum is one drop for
each year of life. If the child has a chill he may be put
into a warm bath of 100&deg;F. It is not wise to cut a burn
blister. The water may be let out by puncturing with a
sterile needle, but the skin must be left intact until the
new skin is grown. The treatment of burns must be done
with the greatest cleanliness because if infected with
germs they may prove serious.</p>

<h4>THE DANGEROUS HOUSE FLY</h4>

<p>Mothers should become thoroughly acquainted with
the grave consequences which may result from fly-infected
foods, and from the possible carriage of disease
by means of flies, even where foods are carefully protected.
The transmission of the following diseases by
means of flies has been conclusively proven: typhoid
fever, tuberculosis, cholera, Oriental plague, inflammation
of the eyelids, serious infection of wounds. Summer
diarrhea of children is also transmitted in this way.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever and summer diarrhea of children in
this country, and cholera and Oriental plague in the
countries in which those diseases exist, may be transmitted
through the various foods that are eaten in an uncooked
state, if infected by flies, through cooked foods
infected by flies after the process of cooking, through
drinking water which has been infected by flies, and
through milk similarly infected. Fruits are especially
likely to be infected by the small fruit fly commonly
found around markets and stands. Fish may be infected
by flies, and in consequence will undergo rapid
decomposition. Decomposition caused in this way has
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a>]</span>
resulted in many cases of diarrhea and dysentery. What
is commonly known as fly speck is the excreta of the
fly, and frequently contains virulent disease germs. These
specks are often found on foodstuffs that have not been
properly protected.</p>

<p>Transmission of disease may also occur by the infection
of open wounds through contact with infected flies.
This is true of all pus formation in wounds. The simple
contact of a fly infected with the disease may cause
Oriental plague, sore eyes, and possibly granular eyelids.
A fly infected with dysentery or typhoid fever may cause
either of these diseases by simply coming in contact with
the lips of susceptible persons.</p>

<p>The fly in the house should be relentlessly pursued and
destroyed. The house which is carefully screened and
protected from flies is infinitely safer than one not so
protected. In the spring of the year the house fly begins
to take on life. Eggs which were laid the preceding fall
begin to hatch. At first the fly is only a little worm wriggling
in some pile of filth. The eggs are usually laid and
the grub developed in a manure pile or some mass of
garbage or other filth. Before the grub develops into
the fly it is easily destroyed. If everything in and about
the house were kept scrupulously clean, and if every
manure pile were kept carefully screened or covered so
as to protect it from flies, there would be no difficulty in
preventing the fly nuisance. The most effective way to
accomplish this is to destroy the breeding places. The
importance of this may be seen when it is considered that
one fly produces one hundred and twenty-five millions or
more of its kind in one season.</p>

<p><b>Stables</b>.&mdash;Manure is by far the commonest material in
which the fly lays her eggs. All stables should be kept
scrupulously clean. No manure should be allowed to accumulate
where it will be exposed to flies for even a few
minutes. Immediately after it is dropped by an animal,
it should be removed and covered. Manure may be
treated with considerable quantities of lime without interfering
with its fertilizing value, and in this way the development
of the eggs laid in it by the flies can be practically
prevented. The floors of stables should be thoroughly
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a>]</span>
flushed with water at least once in every twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p><b>Privy Vaults</b>.&mdash;Human excrement also affords an excellent
breeding place for flies. In army camps the
latrines are the points from which much infection is transmitted
to troops, and thousands of the men have lost
their lives by contracting typhoid fever transmitted in this
manner. During the summer time all open vaults and dry
closets should be treated continuously with lime, crude
creolin or crude carbolic acid, and they should be carefully
cleaned out at frequent intervals.</p>

<p><b>Garbage</b>.&mdash;As a medium for the development of flies,
garbage may be considered next in importance to excreta.
The eggs of the fly hatch in about twenty-four hours, and
garbage which is retained in the kitchen for that length
of time may contain flies in the grub stage. To prevent
this development, all garbage should be covered and
pails should be emptied as often as possible. In country
districts garbage should be burned in the kitchen or
buried in the garden at frequent intervals, twenty-four
hours being the maximum time it should be retained.</p>

<p><b>Vacant Lots</b>.&mdash;Vacant lots frequently contain appreciable
quantities of organic matter in a state of decomposition,
affording favorable breeding places for flies.
These vacant areas should be maintained in a state of
scrupulous cleanliness.</p>

<p><b>Foodstuffs</b>.&mdash;In order to prevent contamination of
foodstuffs, all foods that are eaten in the raw state and
all foods that are exposed for sale after having been
cooked should be carefully protected from contact with
flies, by screens or covers.</p>

<p>A point where rapid development of flies takes place
is along the city's water front. This is due to the fact
that many of the sewers do not discharge below the level
of the water. All open drains should be eliminated,
whether they be sewers, private house drains or drains
from cess-pools.</p>

<p><b>Precautions to be Observed</b>.&mdash;Keep the house free
from flies. Every fly should be considered a possible
disease carrier and should be destroyed.</p>

<p>Keep the windows of the house, especially the kitchen
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a>]</span>
windows, carefully screened during the spring, summer
and autumn.</p>

<p>Protect children from exposure to flies, particularly
children who are ill, and do not allow nursing bottles
to be exposed to flies.</p>

<p>Protect milk and other foodstuffs from contact with
flies.</p>

<p>Keep the garbage outside of the house, carefully
covered.</p>

<p>Abolish open drains near dwelling places.</p>

<p>Stable manure should be frequently sprinkled with
lime and kept covered.</p>

<p>Earth closets and privy vaults should be treated with
lime, crude creolin or crude carbolic acid at frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>Earth closets and privy vaults should be cleaned frequently
in order to prevent excrement accumulating to an
undue extent.</p>

<p><b>To Kill Flies</b>.&mdash;Dissolve one dram of bichromate of
potash in two ounces of water, add a little sugar to this
solution and put some of it in shallow dishes and place
about the house. Sticky fly paper and fly traps may also
be used.</p>

<p>To clean the room where there are many flies, burn
pyrethrum powder (Persian insect powder). This stupefies
the flies and in this condition they may be swept up
and burned.</p>

<p>Probably the best and simplest fly killer is a weak
solution of formaldehyde in water (two teaspoonfuls to
the pint). This solution should be placed in plates or
saucers throughout the house. Ten cents' worth of formaldehyde,
obtained in the drug store, will last an ordinary
family all summer. Don't smell formaldehyde in
the pure state; it is very pungent and strong. In the
solution of the strength used for flies it has no offensive
smell. It is fatal to disease organisms, and is practically
non-poisonous except to insects. Flies will not
stay in the house when this solution is around.</p>

<p><b>Moths</b>.&mdash;Late spring and early summer is the time to
guard against moths and beetles. Many of these fabric-destroying
insects are brought into the house on flowers.
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a>]</span></p>

<p>May and June are especially bad months, as both moths
and beetles are only dangerous to fabrics in their young
or grub stage.</p>

<p>These insects will destroy almost anything from coarse
rugs to the finest of ball gowns and dress suits. Carpets
that are rarely swept and garments that are seldom disturbed
are most liable to damage.</p>

<p>The substitution of the frequently removed and easily
cleaned rugs for carpets will greatly lessen the danger
from the destructive moth and beetle grubs. Carpets laid
on tight floors are much less liable to injury than where
numerous cracks furnish safe retreats for the insects.
Tarred paper under a carpet is an excellent preventive.</p>

<p>All clothes presses should be thoroughly cleaned at
frequent intervals. The garments should be removed,
aired and vigorously brushed. Any larv&aelig; which are not
dislodged in this way should be destroyed. It is a bad
plan to keep odds and ends of woolen or other materials
in attics where these pests can breed and thus spread
to more valuable articles.</p>

<p>Spraying with benzine two or three times during hot
weather is a good way of preventing injury to furniture
or carriage upholstery and other articles which are in
storage or not in use for a long time. If you are certain
that woolens and furs are free from the pests they
may be stored in safety by placing them in tight paste
board boxes and sealing the covers firmly with gummed
paper.</p>

<p>Both moths and carpet beetles are harmless at a temperature
of 40 degrees Fahrenheit&mdash;a fact very well
known to advantage by the large fur storage companies.
They cannot survive furthermore a temperature of 120
decrees if subjected to it for about twenty minutes.</p>

<p><b>What Physicians are Doing</b>.&mdash;It is desirable that the
ordinary non-medical individual should know what the
science of medicine is doing and what it is accomplishing.</p>

<p>During the past fifteen years the art of curing and
preventing disease has taken on giant strides. The man
or woman most ready to question the accomplishments
and the ability of the humble family physician or the
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a>]</span>
motive of the science of medicine, is the one who appreciates
least that it is due to the skill and intelligence of
the medical men of to-day that he owes his comfort, his
health, and his freedom from pestilence, plague and disease.
Unthinking people laud and praise some upstart
whose ability lies in his faculty to fool the gullible, or they
will rush to seek the false aid of some nondescript science,
because it is popular and well advertised, while they pass
by or ignore the men whose labors have made the world
what it is, and who alone possess the ability to intelligently
wage the battle in the interest of humanity against disease.</p>

<p>The medical profession has repeatedly pointed out that
there are, on an average, six hundred thousand lives lost
every year in the United States from preventable disease
and accidents. Six hundred thousand lives which medical
science has at hand the remedy to save, but which the medical profession
sacrificed because of inadequate legislation. Few people
can comprehend just what six hundred thousand lives
mean. Let us put it in another way. There are destroyed
by preventable disease and accidents every day American
lives equal in number to the crews of two battle ships,
equal in three months to more than the total combined
numbers of the Army and Navy of the United States;
equal in one year to more than the total number of lives
lost in all our wars since the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>The <i>Titanic</i> disaster shocked the public for a moment,
and seemed to impress them as though it was a terrible
and unheard of waste of good human lives. Yet in the
loss of life due to preventable causes we have in this country
every day in the year a destruction of our citizens exceeding
in magnitude that which occurred when the
<i>Titanic</i> sank. Think of it! A <i>Titanic</i> disaster a day, and
yet the public does not rise up and demand in a spirit of
anger and determination that steps be taken at once to
put an end to this appalling and unnecessary waste of
lives.</p>

<p>Under modern hygienic conditions, the average length of
existence for an individual in Great Britain has increased
ten years in the last half century. Among all the enlightened
and advanced nations, the expectation of the individual
for long survival is greater. Since the appearance of
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a>]</span>
uncheckable and epidemic disorders is less frequent and
the percentage of cures is greater.</p>

<p>Since quarantine has been regularly established and
the sewage system made efficient in large cities, and since
the sanitary plumbing laws have been made compulsory,
the general death rate has decreased enormously. These
regulations have been the product of regularly educated
medical or sanitary experts. No 'ism or 'ology has ever
established any scientific principle which has contributed
to the general welfare of the people. We no longer fear
the plague, or typhus or yellow fever, cholera, diphtheria,
typhoid, consumption, and other diseases which once were
a constant menace to the race. The plague, for example,
is practically limited to the Far East, where modern
methods cannot evidently be introduced efficiently. At
one time it periodically devastated Europe, where it cannot
now get a foothold because of the introduction of
sanitary systems and hygienic principles.</p>

<p>Tetanus or lockjaw and hydrophobia are now amenable
to cure while formerly all cases were practically fatal.
The mortality of diphtheria has been reduced more than
fifty per cent. Antiseptic precautions in surgical cases,
first introduced by the famous surgeon, Lord Lister, have
made possible and successful operations that formerly
could not be undertaken, thus broadening the whole field
of surgical possibilities. The Boer war and the war with
Spain proved this truth in a way that could not be denied.
Smallpox is almost a medical curiosity in New York City,
where it once was a scourge. The mortality of childbirth
has been reduced to about one-fifth of what it was
by the introduction of antiseptics and anesthetics. The
new methods of making and preparing drugs, the sterilization
and inspection of milk, the methods devised for the
care of and preparation of infant foods have all enormously
contributed to checking disease, to preventing disease,
and to increasing the length of life and its happiness.</p>

<p>These are all facts which may be proved by any one,
no matter how incompetent they may be. If we were to
give up all these hard earned victories, cease to investigate
or experiment, deny the existence of disease, and depend
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a>]</span>
upon the questionable methods of hysterical emotionalists
we would soon find ourselves facing all the horrors of the
past. Can we afford to lose the priceless benefits we
have achieved and are attaining? Can we sit still and
permit the profession of medicine, which has always contained
the best of the race in its membership, the best intellects,
the most sympathetic and unselfish characters,
the noblest and most steadfast souls, to be maligned and
assailed, to have its means of well-doing assaulted and
threatened, when we know that it should be supported
and protected for the sake of all it has done in the past
in the interest of humanity?</p>

<p>Every mother should be acquainted with these facts
so that she may lend her influence in behalf of honest
effort and honest inquiry.</p>

<p>The following summary comprises a brief review of
what medicine has been doing in the recent past:</p>

<p><b>Radium</b>.&mdash;This element was discovered about fifteen
years ago by Professor and Mme. Curie. It possesses the
wonderful property of giving out inexhaustible stores of
energy. It virtually possesses the property of perpetual
motion. Professor Becquerel was the first one to suggest
that it might possess therapeutic or healing powers. The
suggestion came to him in a curious way. He carried a
tube of radium in his vest pocket and was severely burnt
as a consequence. The incident suggested to him that, if
radium could attack healthy tissue in such a short time, it
should be able to similarly attack diseased tissue. Experiments
were soon instituted, and are still being conducted
to exactly define its curative value and scope.</p>

<p>It was hailed as a cure for cancer and other serious
conditions, but we have found that it is not a cure
for these ailments. It is, however, exceedingly valuable
in the treatment of certain skin diseases. In lupus,
epithelial tumors, ulcers, papillomata, angiomata and pruritus,
it is being widely and successfully used. It was
later discovered that it can quickly kill disease-producing
bacteria. It is also well known that it will efficiently
purify water.</p>

<p><b>X-Ray Treatment and X-Ray Diagnosis</b>.&mdash;Professor
Roentgen gave to the world an exceedingly valuable discovery
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a>]</span>
in the X-Ray. He discovered that a certain form
of electrical energy, when applied in a certain way, would
produce shadows that differentiated between a certain
degrees of opacity. For example, it would, if directed
upon the human hand, produce shadows that clearly indicated
whether the substance through which the rays
passed was bone or muscle. The chief value of the
X-Rays has been found to be this property rather than
any healing value which has been attributed to them. The
fact that these shadows can be photographed has rendered
them of supreme value in surgery and medicine. Previously
it was essential that the surgeon should depend
upon his own diagnosis, upon what he could learn from
his sense of touch and from surrounding conditions. With
the X-Rays at his disposal he can quite eliminate the
personal equation. His pictures are precise and mathematically
accurate; he can prove the truth of his diagnosis
before he cuts. We can take pictures of fractured bones
and from what we learn we can immediately tell how they
should be set to attain the very best results. We can
actually tell if there is a stone in the kidney before we
subject the patient to a serious operation. We can actually
take pictures of the stomach at various stages of
digestion and tell what disease affects the individual with
a degree of precision that was not possible before the
X-Rays were introduced. These examples only suggest
its use. There are a multiplicity of uses for these as yet
unknown rays which have greatly aided in diagnosis and
consequently in successful treatment.</p>

<p><b>Aseptic Surgery</b>.&mdash;The utility of the aseptic principle
in surgery was demonstrated by the Japanese army surgeons
during the war with Russia in 1904-1905. Their
success in preventing deaths from suppurating wounds
amazed the world. Their method was to discard the use
of antiseptics and to depend upon absolutely clean instruments,
dressings and hands. The most terrible wounds
healed under this method without festering. This is, of
course, the method in vogue to-day all over the civilized
world. The Japanese did not discover aseptic surgery,
but they were the first to put it to actual test in a large
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_654" id="Page_654">654</a>]</span>
way. The old method was to depend upon drugs to kill
the germs which might find their way into wounds and
operations. To-day we prevent the germs from getting
into the wound and depend upon nature to do the rest.</p>

<p><b>New Anesthetics</b>.&mdash;Several important advances have
been made in methods of giving anesthetics and in the
nature of the products used. Temporary unconsciousness
with electricity was induced in 1909 by Dr. Stephane
Leduc. Stovaine was invented by Dr. Jonnesco, of Bucharest.
He injected it into the spinal cord after the
method made famous by Biers with cocaine in 1899. Dr.
W. S. Schley invented novocaine for the same purpose.
Temporary unconsciousness was accomplished by the use
of epsom salts injected into the spinal cord by Dr.
Samuel J. Meltzer. All of these efforts to discover a
harmless anesthetic by spinal injection were made possible
by investigations and experiments of Dr. J. Leonard
Corning, of New York, who worked along this line as far
back as 1885. The most revolutionary discovery, however,
was that of Dr. S. J. Meltzer at the Rockefeller Institute,
New York, when he inserted a tube into the windpipe,
through which he pumped the anesthetic into the
lungs. While doing this he at the same time pumped
oxygen to aerate the blood, thus ensuring the patient
against possible accident during the course of difficult
and tedious operations on the lungs and heart.</p>

<p><b>Vaccine in Typhoid Fever</b>.&mdash;Inasmuch as typhoid
fever has played an important part in the conduct of all
wars, it has always been a source of much careful study
by military and naval surgeons in every civilized country
in the world. We had not, however, reached a stage
when it was possible to hope for its extermination until
medical science began to appreciate the possibilities of
vaccine therapy. The Cuban, Boer and Russian wars, because
of the terrible experiences of the soldiers with typhoid
in each of them, stimulated inquiry along the line
of discovering a serum of vaccine that would be effectual
against it. American, British, French and Japanese military
and naval surgeons instituted experiments simultaneously
to discover an anti-typhoid vaccine. In the fall
of 1909, American army surgeons were experimenting
<span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a>]</span>
with a serum at Washington and on Governor's Island
with success, but the first public announcement of an
absolutely successful vaccine was made by Captain Vincent
of the French navy on June 20th, 1910, before the
Acad&eacute;mie de Medicine in Paris. The final success of the
anti-typhoid serum has been conclusively proved by elaborate
tests upon soldiers and sailors in many nations.</p>

<p>It is difficult for the ordinary individual to appreciate
the significance and importance of a discovery of this
character and magnitude. When one thinks calmly of
the thousands and thousands of men who have lost their
lives during wars because of typhoid epidemics, and of
the thousands of others who have returned home practically
invalided for life from the same cause, it is possible
to, at least, conceive of the benefit to the race such
a discovery promises. And when we learn that the discovery
is a product of the same principle or method which
gave to the world a cure for smallpox, diphtheria and
syphilis, we must begin to believe that the medical profession
is on the path which is unlimited in its field of
promise so far as efficient treatment is concerned. Yet
to-day we have people who do not believe in vaccination
or in anti-diphtheritic serum. We may not live to see
the time, but it is not far distant in the opinion of men
qualified to speak with authority, when every disease will
be amenable to the serum therapy, and when drugs will
virtually be discarded by the human race.</p>

<p><b>"606."</b>&mdash;One of the most important discoveries in the
history of medicine was recently given to the world by
Dr. Paul Ehrlich.</p>

<p>He called it "606," because it was the 606th experiment
he had made with the same end in view. It was designed
with the purpose of curing the most terrible disease
known to man, syphilis. The name of the remedy is
salvarsan. That it will do all that was first claimed for
it is still doubtful, but salvarsan and its improvements,
neosalvarsan, etc., are accepted by the profession as by
far the best treatment yet devised for this dread disease.
It points the way for improvement along the same line
to an ultimate specific.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[<a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a>]</span></p>

<p><b>Transplanting the Organs of Dead Men Into Living Men</b>.&mdash;To
take from a recently dead individual a kidney,
or a bone, or an artery, and by immersing them in certain
fluids thereby keeping them alive indefinitely, and later
transplanting them in the body of a living individual so
that they will continue to live and perform their function
in the new environment, is a revolutionary and a seemingly
incredible performance. Yet Dr. Alexis Carrel of
the Rockefeller Institute, New York, has accomplished
this wonderful task. The smallest imagination can picture
the possibilities of this kind of surgery, but, inasmuch
as the discovery is so recent and the opportunities
for testing it upon human beings are so relatively few,
that time alone can tell how far it may be possible to go.</p>

<p><b>Anti-Meningitis Serum</b>.&mdash;Another important discovery
that has emanated from the Rockefeller Institute
is the Anti-Meningitis serum. The death rate from spinal
meningitis, before the introduction of the serum, was 70
per cent., the use of the serum has reduced this percentage
to 30. We owe this important contribution to Dr. Simon
Flexner.</p>

<p><b>A Serum for Malaria Now Possible</b>.&mdash;Dr. C. C. Bass,
of Tulane University, has succeeded in extracting malaria-producing
parasites from human blood and keeping
them alive in test tubes. This feat had been long attempted
but never before with success. The significance
of this achievement is that it is the first step toward preparing
a serum that will give immunity to malaria.</p>
